  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts two perspectives on success and wealth using a \"Yes, But\" format. On the left, soccer players are celebrating a victory, holding a trophy, and being cheered by an excited crowd, symbolizing public triumph and fame. On the right, the satirical twist shows the players in a luxurious car with money falling out, juxtaposed with people crammed into a crowded bus. \n\nThis highlights the disparity between the glamorous image of sports success and the reality of wealth and privacy, suggesting that while the public sees victory and celebration, there's an underlying narrative of material wealth and exclusivity. The humor lies in the exaggerated contrast and the unexpected behind-the-scenes peek at the implications of success.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as a team and its are all celebrating on the ground after winning the match, but after the match, the fans are standing in the bus uncomfortably, while the players are travelling inside a carring the cup as well as the prize money, which the fans did not get a dime of."
