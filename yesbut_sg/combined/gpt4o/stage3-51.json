  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from its satirical take on human behavior regarding littering. The left side simply shows a trash can icon, representing the straightforward idea of properly disposing trash. The right side humorously contrasts this with a scene where a hand is about to drop a candy wrapper through a railing, which is not a trash can. \n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" suggests an awareness of the correct behavior (using a trash can) but then humorously highlights the contradictory or lazy action of littering instead. This satirical illustration pokes fun at the discrepancy between knowing the right thing to do and actually doing it.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic because even though garbage bins are provided for humans to dispose waste, by habit humans still choose to make surroundings dirty by disposing garbage improperly"
