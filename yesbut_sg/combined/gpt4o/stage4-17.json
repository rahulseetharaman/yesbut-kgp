  "final_answer": "This image is funny or satirical because it juxtaposes the themes of rebellion and consumerism. \n\nOn the left, there are t-shirts with boxing glove graphics and texts like \"strength gathering\" and \"we work we hate, to buy things we don't need,\" highlighting the satirical nature of anti-consumerist messaging being commercialized on t-shirts. \n\nOn the right, a person is wearing a \"FIGHT CLUB\" shirt while working at a computer, which contrasts with the anti-establishment themes of the \"Fight Club\" movie. The setting with a water cooler and computer suggests an office environment, further emphasizing the irony of trying to display rebellion while conforming to conventional work life. The caption \"YES, BUT\" humorously acknowledges this contradiction.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as the t-shirt says \"We work jobs we hate, to buy sh*t we don't need\", which is a rebellious message against the construct of office jobs. However, the person wearing the t-shirt seems to be working in an office environment. Also, the t-shirt might have been bought using the money earned via the very same job."
