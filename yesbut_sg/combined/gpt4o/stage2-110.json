  "final_answer": "The image plays with the structure of expectations and contradictions, using the repeated phrase \"YES, BUT\" to create humor. Each panel presents an initially positive or straightforward scenario (\"YES\"), followed by a surprising twist or contradiction (\"BUT\") that undermines or alters the initial impression.\n\nFor example:\n- A muscular man is seen engaging in a strong or confident action (\"YES\"), but the next panel shows an unexpected or contrasting situation involving him.\n- A boxer is shown triumphantly (\"YES\"), but the subsequent panel reveals a humorous or ironic detail that changes the context.\n\nThe humor arises from these unexpected contrasts that subvert what the viewer anticipates, creating a satirical take on appearances versus reality. The response in the image also adds an additional layer of satire by pointing out a perceived overreaction or misunderstanding of the joke's intent, further playing with themes of communication and interpretation.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image there are many memes on men but in the second image a person is seen raising voice over some meme on woman and calling it as woman bully but no one raises their voice against memes over man calling them as man bully"
