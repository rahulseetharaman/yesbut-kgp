  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the contrast between the men's initial eagerness to light the woman's cigarette and their subsequent reaction to the unpleasant smell of the smoke. In the first panel, the men appear enthusiastic and attentive, going out of their way to help the woman. However, in the second panel, the tables turn as they are visibly repulsed by the green smoke she emits, pinching their noses in disgust. This unexpected shift in their behavior highlights the irony and absurdity of their situation, creating a humorous effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as people seem to be holding lighters to light up a woman's cigarette at an attempt to probably  impress her, while showing that the very same people are holding their noses on account of what appears to be bad smell coming out of the woman's mouth."
