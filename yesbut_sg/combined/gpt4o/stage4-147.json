  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of expectation and reality. The text \"YES,\" suggests approval or affirmation, represented by the presence of a double socket, which implies compatibility for plugging in devices. However, the \"BUT\" half humorously contrasts this with the large, oversized plug that clearly cannot fit into the sockets provided.\n\nThis creates a visual and conceptual contradiction, highlighting the often frustrating experience of having incompatible technology. The image humorously captures the ironic frustration of everyday situations where things should work in theory (\"YES\") but don't in practice (\"BUT\").",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny, as there are two electrical sockets side-by-side, but the adapter is shaped in such a way, that if two adapters are inserted into the two sockets, they will butt into each other, leading to inconvenience."
