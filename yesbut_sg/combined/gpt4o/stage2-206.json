  "final_answer": "This image is funny because it portrays a common scenario with an unexpected twist. The phrase \"text me when you get home\" is often used to ensure someone's safety, but in this case, the person who is supposed to respond is asleep. It humorously highlights the irony of the situation\u2014despite the intention to communicate, the person is unable to do so because they\u2019re not awake. The combination of the request and the person's incapacity to reply creates a comedic effect given the play on expectations versus reality.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since they show how a sender wants the recipient to revert once he gets back home but the tired recipient ends up falling asleep completely forgetting about the message while the sender keeps waiting for a reply. The fact that the recipient leaves his phone on silent mode makes it even funnier since the probability of the sender being able to contact him becomes even slimmer."
