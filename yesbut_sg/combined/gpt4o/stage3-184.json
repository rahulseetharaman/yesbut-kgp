  "final_answer": "The image satirizes the common saying \"beauty is inside\" by juxtaposing two contrasting interpretations. \n\nOn the left, there's a floral design with the literal phrase \"Beauty is inside,\" aligning with the traditional understanding that true beauty is internal, not just physical appearance.\n\nOn the right, a stick figure girl is applying makeup in front of a mirror where the same phrase is reflected. This humorously suggests that society often focuses on external appearances and makeup as ways to achieve \"inner beauty,\" despite the original intent of the saying. The setup highlights the irony and contradiction between societal pressures and the ideal of appreciating inner beauty.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is satirical because while the text on the paper says that beauty lies inside, the woman ignores the note and continues to apply makeup to improve her outer beauty."
