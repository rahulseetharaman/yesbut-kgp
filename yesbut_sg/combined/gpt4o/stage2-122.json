  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the absurdity of focusing on the wrong issue. In the first panel, a person is shown in a precarious and hazardous situation, flipping over on a scooter after crashing into a pole. It's a clear indication of a potential physical injury or mishap.\n\nThe second panel adds satire by showing a hand holding a thermometer pointing at the person, reading \"NO COVID,\" as if that's the main concern. This is funny because it highlights the exaggerated focus on COVID-19 safety measures to the point of ignoring immediate physical dangers. The juxtaposition of the serious accident with the trivial reassurance provided by the thermometer reading creates a satirical commentary on misplaced priorities.",
  "ground_truth": "the irony in the image comes from people trying to avoid covid, where a injured person is scanned for covid before they get help."
