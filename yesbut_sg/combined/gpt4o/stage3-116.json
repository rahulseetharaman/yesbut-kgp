  "final_answer": "The image is satirical because it contrasts two different attitudes towards elephants in a humorous way. On the left, a person is depicted as sad while watching a small elephant inside a caged TV, symbolizing concern for captive or exploited animals seen in media. On the right, another person is happily taking a selfie while riding a large elephant, representing the irony and hypocrisy of being concerned about animals while simultaneously enjoying direct interactions with them, often seen in tourism. The juxtaposition highlights the conflicting attitudes people can have regarding animal welfare and entertainment.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the people who get sentimental over imprisoned animal while watching TV shows often feel okay when using animals for labor"
