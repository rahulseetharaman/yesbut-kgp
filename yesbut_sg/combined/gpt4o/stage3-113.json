  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from contrasting expectations and reality. \n\nIn the first panel, we see simple, generic stick figures: the female figure is using a fork to eat what appears to be salad, while the male figure is holding a burger. This sets up a typical, perhaps stereotypical, scene of how people eat based on gender norms.\n\nIn the second panel, the scene is more realistic and detailed. The woman is using chopsticks to eat a burger and fries, which is unexpected and not the usual way to consume such food. This subverts the expectation set by the first panel, creating a humorous twist.\n\nThe caption \"YES, BUT\" adds to the satire, indicating that while things might appear typical at first glance, reality can be quite different and unexpected.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic because in the first image it is shown that the woman has got salad for her but she is having french fries from the man's plate which displays that the girl is trying to show herself as health conscious by having a plate of salad for her but she wants to have to have fast food but rather than having them for herself she is taking some from other's plate"
