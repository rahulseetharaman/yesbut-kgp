  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from contrasting expectations versus reality. \n\nOn the left side, the simple icon of two figures under a blanket represents the concept of warmth and togetherness. It suggests the idealized, cozy notion of sharing a blanket with someone.\n\nOn the right side, the reality is depicted humorously with two people visibly sweating under the blanket. This exaggerated portrayal highlights the uncomfortable truth that while sharing a blanket can symbolize closeness, it can also be physically uncomfortable due to overheating, especially with two bodies generating heat in close proximity.\n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" adds to the humor by acknowledging the ideal (\"YES\") while immediately presenting the counterpoint (\"BUT\") through the illustration, making it a satirical take on an everyday situation.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because after some time cuddling within a blanket raises the temperature which leads to inconvenience"
