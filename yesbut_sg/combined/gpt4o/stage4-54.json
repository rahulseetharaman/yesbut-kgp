  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of the two scenarios depicted on the phones.\n\nOn the left, a person is seen holding a phone with a romantic message, \"You are cute,\" accompanied by a heart symbol. This side conveys a flattering and sweet situation, often associated with positive feelings.\n\nOn the right, however, the phone reflects an unflattering image of a face, with smudges on the screen. This contrast humorously undermines the flattering sentiment from the left side by presenting a relatable and less glamorous reality.\n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" at the top sets up the joke: while one might receive compliments or feel positive about themselves, real life often presents a more humorous or self-deprecating scenario. The satire lies in this contrast between the idealized perception and the often awkward reality.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because person who received the text saying \"you are cute\" is apparently not good looking according to the beauty\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0standards"
