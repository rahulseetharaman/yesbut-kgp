  "final_answer": "This image uses humor by contrasting expectation with reality. On the left, a simple silhouette suggests that pulling a single tissue from a box should be an easy and smooth action, as depicted by the word \"YES.\"\n\nOn the right, labeled as \"BUT,\" a realistic depiction shows a hand inadvertently pulling multiple tissues from a box, humorously highlighting the common, relatable mishap of tissues getting stuck together. This visual comparison satirizes the unexpected small challenges in everyday life.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because even when there is a need of only one napkin but the napkins are so tightly packed that more than one napkin gets out sticked together"
