  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from situational irony. The initial close-up view of the green car suggests it is parked correctly, creating an expectation of proper parking. However, the subsequent wider view reveals that the car is humorously misaligned with the parking space lines. This contrast between expectation and reality creates a comical twist, highlighting the discrepancy in perception from different perspectives. The juxtaposition of the images cleverly uses the phrase \"YES, BUT\" to underline this unexpected outcome, adding to its satirical nature.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny becuase while folding the side mirrors is good when the car is not being used because it prevents damage but it is supposed to be used while driving and parking the car which has not been done in this case leading the car to be parked impropely."
