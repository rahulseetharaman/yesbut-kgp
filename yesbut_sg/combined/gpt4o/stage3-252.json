  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two scenes. On the left, we have a person using a rowing machine indoors, simulating the action of rowing as a form of exercise. On the right, there's a person leisurely driving a motorboat on water.\n\nThe juxtaposition creates a humorous contrast between effort and relaxation: the person on the rowing machine is working hard indoors to mimic a water activity, while the person in the boat is effortlessly powered by an engine outdoors. The \"Yes, But\" format emphasizes this irony, suggesting that one could work out to simulate rowing, but there's also the option of enjoying a leisurely ride without the physical exertion.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because people often use rowing machine at the gym don't prefer rowing when it comes to boats"
