  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the contrast between simplicity and complexity. On the left, a single remote easily controls the TV, depicted with the word \"YES.\" This illustrates the ideal, straightforward setup. On the right, however, a stick figure looks confused and overwhelmed by many remotes, matched with the word \"BUT.\" This highlights the chaotic reality many people face with an overabundance of remotes and options. The humor lies in the relatable discrepancy between wanting simplicity and dealing with complexity.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since they show how even though TV remotes are supposed to make operating TVs easier, having multiple similar looking remotes  for everything only makes it more difficult for the user to use the right one"
