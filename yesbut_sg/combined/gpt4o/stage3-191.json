  "final_answer": "This image is humorous and satirical because it contrasts two depictions of a sunset. On the left, there's a minimalist illustration showing a romantic, idealized sunset with people holding hands in silhouette, capturing a serene and unobstructed view. On the right, the detailed and colorful sunset is marred by a chaotic web of power lines, representing real-life obstructions that often spoil such picturesque moments. The \"YES, BUT\" caption humorously highlights the gap between idealized expectations and reality, mocking how technical and urban elements can intrude on natural beauty.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image clear sky is visible but in the second image the same view is getting blocked due to the electricity pole"
