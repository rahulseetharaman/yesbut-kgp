  "final_answer": "The image uses a humorous twist involving a Rubik's Cube to play with expectations. In the left panel, we see a hand holding a fully red cube, suggesting that the puzzle is solved. However, the right panel reveals that only one side is solved while the rest remain scrambled.\n\nThe humor lies in the discrepancy between expectations and reality. At first glance, it seems like an accomplishment, but the \"BUT\" reveals the truth. This can be seen as a satirical take on situations where things might appear perfectly done until you look at them more closely.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since they show how a jumbled rubiks cube appears solved simply because of the viewers perspective."
