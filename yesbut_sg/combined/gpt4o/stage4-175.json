  "final_answer": "The image uses satire to convey a humorous message about the effects of smiling. On the left side, there is a positive depiction of a person silhouette smiling alongside a happy smiley face, with the word \"SMILE!\" This conveys a cheerful and affirmative attitude, supported by the word \"YES.\"\n\nOn the right side, the word \"BUT\" introduces a contrast. It shows a close-up of a face with wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, highlighting the physical effects of frequent smiling. The juxtaposition of the positive \"SMILE!\" message with the reality of wrinkles pokes fun at the idea that smiling, while positive, can have less glamorous side effects. The humor lies in this exaggerated contrast between societal encouragement to smile and the biological consequence of doing so.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical because while it suggests people to smile it also shows the wrinkles that can be caused around lips and eyes because of smiling"
