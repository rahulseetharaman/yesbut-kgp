  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from its exaggerated and absurd depiction of a common scenario. On the left, a simplistic stick figure is shown struggling to pull a comically oversized plug from a power strip, highlighting a humorous disparity in size and effort. The right side shows a more realistic illustration of a hand simply unplugging a plug from a wall socket.\n\nThe satirical part is the over-the-top challenge that the stick figure faces compared to the mundane task depicted on the right. This exaggeration plays with the idea of how something ordinary can be blown out of proportion, creating a visual joke that contrasts simplicity with absurdity.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because some person is trying to plug out one pin from the multi pin plug but due to tight fitting the multi pin plug socket itself is getting pulled off disconnecting the power supply to other devices even when it is not required"
