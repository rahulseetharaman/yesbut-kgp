  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the relatable situation of creating a strong password that is difficult to remember. In the first panel, the user fills out the \"Create Account\" form with a username and a complex, strong password. However, in the second panel, the \"Sign In\" form shows the user trying to log in but leaving the password field empty and clicking on \"Forgot Password?\" instead. \n\nThis satirizes the common experience of forgetting complicated passwords, despite being encouraged to create them for security reasons. The juxtaposition of having a strong password but immediately forgetting it conveys a humorous take on the struggle between security and convenience.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because people set such a strong passwords for their accounts that they even forget the password and need to reset them"
