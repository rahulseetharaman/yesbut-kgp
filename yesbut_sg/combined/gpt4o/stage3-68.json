  "final_answer": "The image humorously highlights the discrepancy between advertised storage capacity and actual usable space on a phone. \n\n1. **Exaggeration of Advertising**: On the left, the large phone is shown being held up by people, emphasizing its advertised 256 GB storage, implying it's a big deal or a significant feature.\n\n2. **Reality Check**: On the right, another phone is shown with only 235.35 GB of actual available space, humorously pointing out that not all advertised storage is usable due to pre-installed system files and applications.\n\n3. **Textual Contrast**: The words \"YES, BUT\" at the top effectively summarize the situation: the advertised storage might sound impressive (\"YES\"), but the reality isn't quite as fulfilling (\"BUT\").\n\nThis satirical take reflects common consumer frustrations about tech specifications versus real-world usability.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since they show how smartphone manufacturers advertise their smartphones to have a high internal storage space but in reality, the amount of space available to an user is considerably less due to pre-installed software"
