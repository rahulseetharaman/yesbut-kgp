  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from juxtaposing the notion of predicting the future with everyday uncertainties and errors. In the first panel, the fortune teller's crystal ball confidently shows \"FUTURE,\" suggesting clarity and foresight. However, in the second panel, when faced with specific requests like bets, lottery numbers, and investments, the crystal ball humorously displays \"Unknown error.\" \n\nThis satirical twist pokes fun at the unpredictability of life and the inability to predict outcomes in gambling and investing, highlighting the absurdity of relying on fortune-telling for such precise predictions.",
  "ground_truth": "The people who claim to predict the future either find their predictions unsuccessful or avoid themselves from making claims related to finance, lotteries, and bets."
