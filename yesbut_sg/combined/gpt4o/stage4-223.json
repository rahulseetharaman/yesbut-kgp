  "final_answer": "The image is satirical because it contrasts two uses of eco-friendly bags with the phrases \"YES,\" and \"BUT.\" \n\nOn the left, the plain eco bag is empty, emphasizing its intended purpose as an environmentally friendly choice. On the right, the colorful eco bag is filled with items like detergent, a plastic bottle, and cans, all of which are typically single-use or non-eco-friendly. This creates a humorous contradiction: while the use of an eco bag suggests environmental responsibility, filling it with these items undermines that effort. The satire lies in highlighting the irony of using sustainable products in an unsustainable way.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical because in the left image it is written eco bag but in the right image we are keeping items of plastic which is not eco-friendly."
