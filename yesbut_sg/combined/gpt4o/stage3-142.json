  "final_answer": "The image presents a humorous or satirical situation by highlighting the contradiction in labeling a bag as \"ECO BAG\" while it contains non-eco-friendly products. The stick figure is seen writing \"ECO BAG\" on the bag with a large marker, which ironically draws attention to the contents that are not environmentally friendly. The humor arises from this incongruity and the implied critique of superficial or misleading eco-friendly claims. The text \"YES, BUT\" emphasizes the contrast between the label and the reality, pointing out the irony in calling something eco-friendly when it clearly is not.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical because in the left image it is written eco bag but in the right image we are keeping items of plastic which is not eco-friendly."
