  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the ironic contrast between what each person is listening to and their surroundings. In the first panel, a person is indoors, listening to \"Birdsongs\" through headphones on a laptop, which is funny because they are seeking the sounds of nature digitally while being cut off from it physically. In the second panel, another person is in an actual forest, yet they are disconnected from their environment by listening to hip-hop music through headphones. The satire lies in the juxtaposition of their choices, highlighting the irony of how people often look for an experience opposite to their current setting.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because people nowadays at home want to feel the nature but when the same person gets some moments to enjoy the nature they just ignore the surroundings"
