  "final_answer": "The image uses satire to highlight a real-life frustration: situations where everything seems perfect for pedestrians to cross safely\u2014the pedestrian sign and traffic light both signal it's time to walk\u2014but there's an unexpected obstacle, in this case, the bus blocking the crosswalk. The \"YES, BUT\" text underscores the irony, suggesting that even when conditions appear favorable, there's often something that complicates matters. This plays on the common experience of encountering unforeseen problems, making it humorous and relatable.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because even when the signal is green for the pedestrians but they can't cross the road because of the vehicles standing on the zebra crossing"
