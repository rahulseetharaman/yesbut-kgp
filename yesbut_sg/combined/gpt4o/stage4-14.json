  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the unexpected contrast between the man's formal attire and his festive socks. This juxtaposition creates a visual joke: he appears serious and sophisticated at first glance, but the socks reveal a playful and quirky side. The text \"YES, BUT\" enhances the humor by setting up an expectation that is humorously subverted by the socks, highlighting the contrast between outward appearances and hidden quirks.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as the person wearing a formal black suit and pants, is wearing colorful socks, probably due to the reason that socks are not visible while wearing shoes, and hence, do not need to be formal."
