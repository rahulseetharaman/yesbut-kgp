  "final_answer": "The image is satirical because it highlights the irony of using an eco-friendly bag to carry non-environmentally friendly items, like plastic bottles and bags. The comic strip printed on the bag itself adds humor by juxtaposing the idea of environmental consciousness (\"Yes\") with the reality of ineffective practice (\"But\"). This illustrates how efforts to be environmentally friendly can sometimes be negated by other actions, pointing out the inconsistency in behavior while making a humorous commentary on sustainability efforts.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical because in the left image it is written eco bag but in the right image we are keeping items of plastic which is not eco-friendly."
