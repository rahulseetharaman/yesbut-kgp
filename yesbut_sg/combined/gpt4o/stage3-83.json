  "final_answer": "This image is humorous because it highlights a common yet illogical scenario. On one side, there's an empty shopping cart, and on the other, a person struggling to carry multiple groceries in their arms. The humor comes from the obvious solution being ignored: using the cart to hold the items. The \"YES, BUT\" text setup emphasizes the contradiction, making the situation both recognizable and amusing. It's a playful commentary on human tendencies to complicate simple tasks.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because even when there are steel frame baskets are available at the supermarkets people prefer carrying the items in hand"
