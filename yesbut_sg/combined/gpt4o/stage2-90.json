  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two panels and the concept of double standards. In the first panel, a man is casually eating chips and ignoring a woman who is vacuuming and looks annoyed. This could suggest a typical domestic scene where one person is lounging while the other is working, highlighting a stereotype of unequal domestic responsibilities.\n\nIn the second panel, labeled \"BUT,\" the roles reverse. The woman is now eating messily in a car, creating a mess with crumbs on her shirt, while the man is driving. This flip illustrates that both genders can exhibit similar behaviors in different contexts, creating a satirical take on the typical expectations of domestic roles and behaviors. The humor lies in the exaggerated and unexpected role reversal.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the left image she is seen how sincere she is about keeping her home clean but in the right image she forgets these principles while travelling in the car"
