  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the ironic contradiction between the two Twitter profiles shown. On the left, the profile claims ownership of the account and acknowledges that the content is \"usually taken from original owner,\" indicating a parody or re-posting nature.\n\nOn the right, the same profile shows that the viewer has been blocked. The text above, \"YES, I am the owner BUT, I am blocked,\" highlights this contradiction. The satire lies in the absurdity of claiming ownership while simultaneously being blocked, suggesting that there might be an ongoing issue of content appropriation or parody that has led to the blocking, thereby creating an amusing situation of conflicting realities.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic since while the page \"Yes, But\" credits the original creator \"@like_gudim\" for its posts, the page \"Yes, But\" has blocked \"@like_gudim\" from following the page"
