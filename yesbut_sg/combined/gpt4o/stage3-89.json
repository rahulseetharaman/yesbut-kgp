  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the juxtaposition of two panels labeled \"YES,\" and \"BUT.\" \n\nIn the \"YES,\" panel, there are many silhouettes of people engaging actively with scooters, accompanied by birds, suggesting a lively and modern urban environment. This depicts a positive and bustling scene of people enjoying mobility and outdoor activities.\n\nThe \"BUT\" panel shows a road in poor condition with numerous potholes, highlighting a potential obstacle to using scooters effectively. \n\nThe satire lies in the contrast between the promotion of scooters for modern transportation and the reality of inadequate infrastructure that makes scooter use impractical or difficult. This highlights a common issue in urban planning where new technologies are embraced, but necessary improvements to infrastructure lag behind.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because even after when the skateboard scooters are available for someone to ride but the road has many potholes that it is not suitable to ride the scooters on such roads"
