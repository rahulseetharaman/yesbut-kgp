On the right, titled \"BUT,\" is a stark black silhouette of simple flowers in a black vase beside a tombstone, suggesting death or memorial.\n\nThe humor or satire lies in contrasting the lively, cheerful scene with the somber, minimalist one. It could be poking fun at overly optimistic views by juxtaposing them with the inevitable reality of mortality, highlighting how perspectives can change dramatically with context.",
