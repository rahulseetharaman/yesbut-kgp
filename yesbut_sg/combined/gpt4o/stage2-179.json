  "final_answer": "This image is funny and satirical because it highlights the contradiction between wanting a job and avoiding unknown calls, which could be from potential employers. \n\nIn the first panel, the person eagerly sends out their resume, indicating enthusiasm about job applications. The accompanying text \"YES,\" implies readiness or eagerness. In the second panel, however, the person immediately rejects an \"Unknown\" incoming call, which humorously undercuts that enthusiasm with caution or reluctance. The \"BUT\" emphasizes this contradiction, suggesting a common social habit of avoiding unknown numbers despite actively seeking opportunities where those calls might come into play.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because on the left image the person is sending their resume to someone and on the right they are rejecting the unknown calls which might be some offer calls  or the person who sent the resume maybe tired of the spam calls after sending the resume which he sent seeking some new oppurtunities"
