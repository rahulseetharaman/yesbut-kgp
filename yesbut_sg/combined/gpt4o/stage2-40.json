  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the play on \"expectation vs. reality.\" Initially, the man appears to have tattoos on his arms, which gives him a muscular and tough appearance. However, the close-up reveals that what looked like tattoos are actually patterns formed by his arm hair, swirling in unexpected designs. This visual juxtaposition of tattoos versus hair patterns is funny because it subverts the viewer's expectations and highlights the surprise that what seems to be intentional (the tattoos) is actually natural (the hair swirls). The comic effectively uses this twist to create a humorous and satirical effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny because while from the distance it seems that the man has big tattoos on both of his arms upon a closer look at the arms it turns out there is no tattoo and what seemed to be tattoos are just hairs on his arm."
