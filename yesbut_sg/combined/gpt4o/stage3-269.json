  "final_answer": "The humor in the image stems from the contrast between the two panels. On the left, a strong woman is lifting a heavy barbell, suggesting strength and physical fitness. This is juxtaposed with the right panel, where a hand is pressing a button on an elevator panel to go up just one floor.\n\nThe satirical element lies in the irony: despite demonstrating considerable physical strength in the gym, as shown by weightlifting, the person opts for the convenience of the elevator for a minimal climb. The use of \"YES,\" and \"BUT\" highlights this contrast between effort and convenience, making it funny and relatable.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is satirical because it shows that while people do various kinds of exercises and go to gym to stay fit, they avoid doing simplest of physical tasks like using stairs instead of elevators to get to even the first or the second floor of a building."
