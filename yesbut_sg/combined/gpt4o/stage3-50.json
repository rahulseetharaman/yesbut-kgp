  "final_answer": "The humor or satire in this image comes from the juxtaposition of the two contrasting panels along with the text \"YES, BUT.\" \n\nOn the left, there's a tidy and minimalistic trash can with a symbol indicating proper litter disposal, suggesting that keeping areas clean is straightforward. The text \"YES,\" suggests agreement or acknowledgment of this ideal behavior.\n\nOn the right, a stick figure is seen handling a messy pile of substance, with the text \"BUT,\" indicating a contradiction or complication. This suggests that despite the existence of a proper disposal method, reality often involves people dealing with messes in less ideal ways.\n\nThe humor arises from this contrast between the ideal and the messy reality, using simple graphics to convey a common human experience in a lighthearted way.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic because even though garbage bins are provided for humans to dispose waste, by habit humans still choose to make surroundings dirty by disposing garbage improperly"
