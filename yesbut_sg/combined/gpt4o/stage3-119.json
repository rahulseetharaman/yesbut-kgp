  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in this image come from the juxtaposition of the two panels under the title \"YES, BUT.\" \n\nOn the left, the scene in the boxing ring uses stick figures to show a generic victory moment where one figure has their hand raised, seemingly signifying a win, and the crowd is cheering.\n\nOn the right, a detailed boxer is shown bruised and battered but smiling with their arm raised. This satirically highlights the common clich\u00e9 of winning a match or achieving success while humorously pointing out the often overlooked realities and struggles behind that success, symbolized by the boxer's bruised state. The contrast between the simplified victory and the gritty reality delivers the comedic effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic because even though a boxer has won the match and it is supposed to be a moment of celebration, the boxer got bruised in several places during the match. This is an illustration of what hurdles a person has to go through in order to succeed."
