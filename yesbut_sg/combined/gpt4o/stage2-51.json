  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the absurdity and impracticality of the depicted situation. \n\nIn the left panel, titled \"YES,\", the hand is holding a plug that is correctly aligned with the power strip's socket, suggesting the correct way to plug it in. However, the socket on the power strip is turned sideways, making it impossible to connect the plug vertically as intended. \n\nIn the right panel, titled \"BUT,\" the attempted solution is shown with the hand again holding the plug horizontally, aligning it with the turned socket. However, the power strip itself remains rotated, keeping the situation unchanged and absurdly unfeasible.\n\nThe satire highlights the frustration of dealing with impractical solutions to simple problems, exaggerating the common annoyance of mismatched or poorly designed equipment.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because some person is trying to plug out one pin from the multi pin plug but due to tight fitting the multi pin plug socket itself is getting pulled off disconnecting the power supply to other devices even when it is not required"
