  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in this image stem from its depiction of contrasting realities in sports. \n\nIn the left panel, a football team is shown triumphantly celebrating under an arch labeled \"WINNERS,\" with a fan enthusiastically cheering in the foreground. This image portrays the traditional glory and public celebration associated with winning a sports event.\n\nIn the right panel, the scene shifts to a darker car holding a large trophy with money flying around, while the team is on a bus next to it. This suggests commentary on how, despite the team's visible success and public adulation, financial gains and rewards might be sidelined or attributed elsewhere. The vehicle's association with the trophy and money humorously indicates that the real \"winners\" in sports could be those benefiting financially off-field.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the two panels highlights the sometimes conflicted nature of success in sports, where public recognition and monetary reward do not always align harmoniously.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as a team and its are all celebrating on the ground after winning the match, but after the match, the fans are standing in the bus uncomfortably, while the players are travelling inside a carring the cup as well as the prize money, which the fans did not get a dime of."
