  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts two different scenarios under the words \"YES, BUT.\" On the left, a silhouette of a student is looking confusedly at a chalkboard filled with complex math equations, with a question mark above their head. This captures the common student experience of feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork.\n\nOn the right, a happy skateboarder stands with a skateboard, seemingly carefree at a skatepark. This contrast suggests that while academic challenges can feel daunting, one might prefer or excel in other activities like skateboarding. The humor lies in the juxtaposition of the stressed student versus the relaxed skateboarder, highlighting different strengths and interests.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical beaucse while the boy does not enjoy studying mathematics and different geometric shapes like semi circle and trapezoid and graphs of trigonometric equations like that of a sine wave, he enjoys skateboarding on surfaces and bowls that are built based on the said geometric shapes and graphs of trigonometric equations."
