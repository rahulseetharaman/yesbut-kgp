  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts two vases of flowers through a visual and contextual punchline. \n\nOn the left, there is an ornate black vase filled with a vibrant variety of flowers, suggesting beauty and abundance. The word \"YES\" implies affirmation or positivity, likely indicating appreciation for the aesthetic.\n\nOn the right, the white vase is placed in front of a tombstone, containing wilted flowers. The word \"BUT\" suggests a contradiction or an unforeseen situation, adding a twist. The contrast between the lively arrangement on the left and the somber context on the right serves as a satirical commentary on expectations versus reality or appearances versus circumstances. \n\nThe humor arises from the juxtaposition of the lively, beautiful arrangement with the dark, humorous setting of a cemetery.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image a vase full of different beautiful flowers is seen which spreads a feeling of positivity, cheerfulness etc., whereas in the second image when the same vase is put in front of a grave stone it produces a feeling of sorrow"
