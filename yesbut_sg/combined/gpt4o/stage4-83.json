  "final_answer": "The image is funny or satirical because it juxtaposes a straightforward solution with a humorous twist on human behavior. On the left side, there is a simple line drawing of a trash can with the text \"YES,\" suggesting the obvious and correct action of disposing trash properly. On the right side, instead of showing someone putting trash into the trash can, it shows a realistic hand dripping trash onto a fence, with the text \"BUT\". This ironic contradiction highlights how people sometimes ignore the proper solution in favor of careless or inappropriate actions, making a satirical comment on human nature and everyday behavior.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic because even though garbage bins are provided for humans to dispose waste, by habit humans still choose to make surroundings dirty by disposing garbage improperly"
