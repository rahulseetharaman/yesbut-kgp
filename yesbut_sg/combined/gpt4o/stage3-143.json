  "final_answer": "The image is satirical because it contrasts the idea of a \"World Tour\" with the limited scope of the actual tour locations. The band is shown performing with a world map behind them and the words \"WORLD TOUR,\" suggesting they are touring globally. However, the adjacent map highlights only a few regions, humorously pointing out that their \"world\" tour is actually quite limited geographically. This plays on the exaggeration often seen in marketing where terms like \"world tour\" are used even for small-scale tours.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image some musical band is showing its poster of world tour but in the right image only a few countries are highlighted as tour countries"
