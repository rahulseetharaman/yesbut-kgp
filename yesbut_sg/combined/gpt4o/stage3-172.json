  "final_answer": "This image is funny or satirical because it captures a common and ironic moment in soccer: players celebrating a goal that is ultimately disallowed due to a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) decision for offside. The left side shows players joyfully jumping in celebration, representing their triumph and excitement. However, this excitement is immediately undercut by the sign on the right stating \"NO GOAL VAR OFFSIDE,\" demonstrating an abrupt change in emotion from joy to disappointment. The humor lies in this contrast and the timing, reflecting the unpredictability and sometimes frustrating nature of modern soccer with VAR decisions.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as the team is celebrating as they think that they have scored a goal, but the sign on the screen says that it is an offside, and not a goal. This is a very common scenario in football matches."
