  "final_answer": "The image is satirical by contrasting two scenarios involving elephants. On the left, a person is watching a small, caged elephant on a TV, appearing thoughtful or sad. This reflects how people often express concern for animals when they see them confined or mistreated, usually through mediated experiences like television.\n\nOn the right, another person is taking a selfie while sitting on a large elephant, which is common in tourism where animals are often exploited for entertainment. This highlights the irony and hypocrisy in human behavior\u2014people may sympathize with animals in distress on screen, yet disregard their welfare in real life when it benefits them personally, such as for a photo opportunity. The caption \"YES, BUT\" underscores this contradiction, making the image both funny and critical.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the people who get sentimental over imprisoned animal while watching TV shows often feel okay when using animals for labor"
