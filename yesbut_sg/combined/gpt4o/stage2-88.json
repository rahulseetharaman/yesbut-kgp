  "final_answer": "This image uses humor and satire by juxtaposing two panels. In the first panel, a person is applying red lipstick, suggesting a focus on personal appearance. The second panel humorously contrasts this by showing several cups and glasses, each with lipstick marks. This exaggerates a common occurrence where lipstick leaves marks on drinking vessels, playfully implying that despite the effort put into applying lipstick, its most visible impact is on the objects touched rather than enhancing the person's appearance. The use of the words \"YES,\" and \"BUT\" highlights this irony, creating a lighthearted critique of the situation.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left image suggest that a person applies lipsticks on their lips to make their lips look attractive or to keep them hydrated but on the contrary it gets sticked to the glasses or mugs and gets wasted"
