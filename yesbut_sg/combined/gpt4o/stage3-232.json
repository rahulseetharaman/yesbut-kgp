  "final_answer": "The image humorously juxtaposes the practicality of grocery shopping with the impracticality of car space usage. On the left, a shopping cart is filled with various grocery items, symbolizing a successful shopping trip. On the right, however, the car's trunk is occupied by a large subwoofer, leaving no space for the groceries. The caption \"YES, BUT\" highlights the irony: yes, you can buy groceries, but you can't store them properly due to the oversized subwoofer. The humor arises from this absurd prioritization, poking fun at how some people might choose to prioritize audio equipment over practicality.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because a car trunk was earlier designed to keep some extra luggage or things but people nowadays get speakers installed in the trunk which in turn reduces the space in the trunk and making it difficult for people to store the extra luggage in the trunk"
