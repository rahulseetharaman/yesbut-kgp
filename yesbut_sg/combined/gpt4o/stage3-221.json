  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the contrast between simplicity and complexity. On the left side, the \"YES\" panel depicts a simple scenario with a stick figure holding a single remote, pointed at an old-fashioned TV, suggesting ease and straightforwardness.\n\nContrastingly, the \"BUT\" panel on the right side illustrates a more chaotic scene where a stick figure is surrounded by multiple complex remotes, looking confused. This exaggeration satirizes modern technology\u2019s complexity, highlighting how something that was once simple, like changing channels on a TV, has now become overly complicated due to the plethora of remote controls with numerous buttons and features. The question marks emphasize the figure's bewilderment, enhancing the comedic and relatable take on today's technological advancements.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since they show how even though TV remotes are supposed to make operating TVs easier, having multiple similar looking remotes  for everything only makes it more difficult for the user to use the right one"
