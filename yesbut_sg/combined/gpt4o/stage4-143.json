  "final_answer": "The image humorously highlights the unintended consequences of wearing lipstick. The woman is applying lipstick, which is often associated with enhancing beauty. However, the juxtaposition of \"YES\" and \"BUT\" implies a contrast between the intended and the actual effect. The second panel reveals multiple drinkware items stained with lipstick marks. \n\nThis unexpected twist adds a layer of satire, poking fun at how lipstick ends up leaving marks on cups and glasses, a common but often overlooked inconvenience. The humor arises from recognizing this relatable experience and the contrast between the glamorous act of applying lipstick and its practical consequences.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left image suggest that a person applies lipsticks on their lips to make their lips look attractive or to keep them hydrated but on the contrary it gets sticked to the glasses or mugs and gets wasted"
