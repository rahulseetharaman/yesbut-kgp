  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the unexpected contrast between the two panels. The first panel presents a serene and picturesque view of the ocean through a window, suggesting a calm and peaceful scene. However, the second panel humorously subverts this expectation by depicting a massive wave shaped like a hand overshadowing beachfront buildings, creating an absurd and surreal twist. The wave's hand-like shape adds a playful and exaggerated element, emphasizing the sudden shift from tranquility to impending chaos. The contrast between calm and threat is a common comedic technique used to create surprise and humor.",
  "ground_truth": "The same sea which gives us a relaxation on a normal day can pose a danger to us sometimes like during a tsunami"
