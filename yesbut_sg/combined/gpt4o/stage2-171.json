  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the unexpected contrast between the expectations set by the first panel and the revelation in the second panel. \n\nIn the first panel, the soup appears appetizing with vegetables and broth, implying the presence of shrimp. However, the second panel humorously reveals that the shrimp pieces are just heads and are separate from the soup, playing on the viewer's expectation of enjoying a complete shrimp. The contrast between the appealing soup and the separate, unappetizing shrimp heads creates a comedic effect, highlighting a situation that\u2019s both familiar and absurd.",
  "ground_truth": "when we drink the whole soup, then  it is very healthy. But people eliminate some things which they don't like."
