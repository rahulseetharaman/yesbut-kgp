  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from its unexpected and absurd contrast. On the left, two people are shown using cucumber and potato slices on their eyes, which is a common depiction of a spa or relaxation activity. The vegetables are haphazardly arranged on a table, emphasizing the casual, domestic setting.\n\nOn the right, however, is a crying, sad rabbit sitting in front of an empty whack-a-mole board. The humorous twist lies in the non sequitur connection between these two scenes. The juxtaposition of a peaceful spa-like atmosphere against the incongruity of a rabbit in a seemingly unrelated, melancholic situation creates a surprising and satirical effect. This unexpected pairing showcases an absurd humor often found in satirical cartoons.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic since they show how on one hand humans choose to play with and waste foods like vegetables while the animals are unable to eat enough food and end up starving due to lack of food"
