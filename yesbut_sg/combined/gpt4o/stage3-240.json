  "final_answer": "The image is humorous and satirical due to the juxtaposition of two scenes. On the left, a flock of ducks is crossing the road, stopping traffic as cars wait patiently at a red light. This is a typical, everyday scenario where animals are given the right of way.\n\nOn the right, there is a restaurant with a duck sign, suggesting it serves duck dishes. A person is seen walking towards the restaurant, which creates a humorous and ironic twist. The initial scene where ducks are safely crossing the road contrasts with the idea that they might end up as a meal, playing on the saying \"sitting ducks.\" The text \"YES, BUT\" further highlights the irony and unexpected twist, making it both funny and thought-provoking.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic since they show how a man supposedly cares for ducks since he stops his vehicle to give way to queue of ducks allowing them to safely cross a road but on the other hand he goes to a peking duck shop to buy and eat similar ducks after having them killed"
