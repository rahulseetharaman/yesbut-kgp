  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the unexpected contradiction and impracticality depicted. On the left, a shopping cart is full of groceries, suggesting they need to be transported. On the right, the open car trunk is occupied entirely by a large speaker box, leaving no room for the groceries. \n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" highlights this contradiction\u2014yes, there are groceries, but there's no practical way to transport them in the car due to the oversized speaker. This situation plays on the absurdity of prioritizing a speaker over essential space for groceries, creating a humorous conflict between practicality and exaggerated priorities.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because a car trunk was earlier designed to keep some extra luggage or things but people nowadays get speakers installed in the trunk which in turn reduces the space in the trunk and making it difficult for people to store the extra luggage in the trunk"
