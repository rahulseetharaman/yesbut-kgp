  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the juxtaposition of the text \"YES, BUT\" with the visual context. In the scene, a referee is raising the hand of a boxer, signifying a victory in a typical boxing match. However, the boxer is notably bruised and battered, which contrasts with the typical image of a triumphant, unscathed victor.\n\nThis creates a comedic or satirical effect as the text \"YES, BUT\" reflects that, although the boxer has won, the cost of the victory is evident on his bruised body. It humorously highlights the incongruity often found in achieving success\u2014it\u2019s a win, but not without visible struggle or consequence.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic because even though a boxer has won the match and it is supposed to be a moment of celebration, the boxer got bruised in several places during the match. This is an illustration of what hurdles a person has to go through in order to succeed."
