  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the contrast between expectation and reality. On the left, there's a modern suitcase with wheels, which is typically designed for easy rolling on smooth surfaces. This sets the expectation that the suitcase will be easy to use. However, the right side shows a cobblestone path, which is notoriously difficult for rolling luggage due to its uneven, rocky surface. \n\nThe combination of these two elements under the labels \"YES,\" and \"BUT\" creates a situational irony. It's funny because it highlights the impracticality of using a wheeled suitcase on a surface that is unsuitable for it, despite the design's intention for convenience. This juxtaposition captures the essence of everyday travel woes in a humorous, satirical way.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny because even though the trolley bag is made to make carrying luggage easy, as soon as it encounters a rough surface like cobblestone road, it makes carrying luggage more difficult."
