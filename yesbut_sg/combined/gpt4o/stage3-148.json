  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between appearances and reality, a theme highlighted by the \"YES, BUT\" format. \n\nOn the left, a woman is smiling and taking a selfie on a boat, thriving in a picture-perfect moment. The right side counters this with the reality: a woman appearing sick and leaning over the rail, presumably due to seasickness. The hashtags add a satirical touch \u2014 \"#cleansingthebody\" is used ironically to describe a situation where one is actually unwell, while \"#seasickness\" addresses the literal scenario.\n\nThis juxtaposition humorously critiques social media portrayals by contrasting idealized images with authentic experiences.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image the woman is showing how she is enjoying the sea trip but whereas the second image shows how she is struggling over the trip due to sea sickness which brings up a contrast comparison between the two photos"
