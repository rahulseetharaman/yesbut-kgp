  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of two contrasting scenarios involving ducks. In the first panel labeled \"YES,\" the car stops to allow a family of ducks to safely cross the road, showcasing a considerate and careful behavior.\n\nIn the second panel labeled \"BUT,\" the same car is parked in front of a Chinese restaurant known for serving \"Peking Duck.\" This creates a humorous twist as the image contrasts the car stopping to protect ducks with the man approaching a place where ducks are served as a dish. The irony lies in the transition from protecting ducks to potentially consuming them, highlighting a satirical take on human behavior and dietary choices.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic since they show how a man supposedly cares for ducks since he stops his vehicle to give way to queue of ducks allowing them to safely cross a road but on the other hand he goes to a peking duck shop to buy and eat similar ducks after having them killed"
