  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the incongruity and contrast between the two sides. On the left, the avatar creation software interface features a character with vibrant, colorful hair and trendy accessories, typically associated with a bold or playful personality. This is juxtaposed with the right side, depicting a somber funeral scene, where one character retains the same colorful hairstyle, looking out of place among the traditionally dressed mourners.\n\nThe satire highlights how someone\u2019s virtual, vibrant persona can contrast starkly with real-life situations requiring solemnity, poking fun at the idea of not always fitting societal expectations. The title \u201cYES, BUT\u201d further reinforces the comedic effect by acknowledging the possibilities of self-expression, while pointing out the potential mismatch in different contexts.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the second image it is shown that a group of people is attending someone's death ceremony but one of them is shown as wrongly dressed for that place in first image, his visual appearances doesn't shows his feeling of mourning"
