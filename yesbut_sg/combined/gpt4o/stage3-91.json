  "final_answer": "The image humorously highlights the unintended consequence of wearing lipstick. On the left, a person is shown applying lipstick, which is often associated with glamour and beauty (\"YES\"). However, the right side humorously contrasts this by showing various drinkware marked with lip prints, highlighting how lipstick often leaves marks on cups, glasses, and bottles (\"BUT\"). This creates a satirical portrayal of the realities of wearing lipstick, where the ideal doesn't always match the practical outcome.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left image suggest that a person applies lipsticks on their lips to make their lips look attractive or to keep them hydrated but on the contrary it gets sticked to the glasses or mugs and gets wasted"
