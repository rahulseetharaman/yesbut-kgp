  "final_answer": "The humor in the image lies in the contrast between the left and right panels. On the left, a car is parked legally under a parking sign, suggesting it\u2019s a suitable spot to park. However, the right panel reveals a problem: many birds are perched on wires above the road, and their droppings have made a mess. This creates an unexpected issue for the parked cars, turning a seemingly ideal parking spot into an inconvenient one. The \"YES, BUT\" caption highlights this irony, adding to the satirical nature of the scene.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical such that although there is a place for parking but that place is not suitable because if we place our car there then our car will become dirty from top due to crow beet."
