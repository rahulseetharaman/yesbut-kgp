  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the stark contrast between the two scenes. On the left, there is a shopping cart filled with varied and healthy groceries, representing everyday essentials. On the right, there is a van with an open trunk containing an exaggerated amount of loud audio equipment.\n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" implies a humorous twist on the idea of priorities. While the groceries are practical and necessary, the over-the-top audio setup in the van is excessive and impractical. This juxtaposition highlights the absurdity of choosing to invest in something as extravagant as a van full of speakers instead of focusing on essentials. The humor lies in this exaggerated contrast and the playful commentary on priorities.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because a car trunk was earlier designed to keep some extra luggage or things but people nowadays get speakers installed in the trunk which in turn reduces the space in the trunk and making it difficult for people to store the extra luggage in the trunk"
