  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the person's tattoo and their reaction to a real snake. In the first panel, the person has a snake tattoo, suggesting they might be comfortable or fond of snakes. However, in the second panel, when faced with a real, small snake on the floor, the person is shown standing on a chair, looking afraid.\n\nThe irony is that despite having a snake tattoo, which might imply bravery or admiration for snakes, the individual is scared of an actual snake. This unexpected reaction creates a humorous contrast and plays on the idea that people sometimes like the idea of certain things (like a snake tattoo) more than the reality (a real snake).",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image the tattoo of a snake on someone's hand may give us a hint about how powerful or brave the person can be who is having this tattoo but in the second image the person with same tattoo is seen frightened due to a snake in his house"
