  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the incongruity and absurdity illustrated in the two panels. \n\nOn the left, there is an empty fridge door compartment, logically designed to hold eggs. However, the right panel humorously contrasts this by showing a full egg carton awkwardly placed in another compartment instead of utilizing the intended one. This scenario exaggerates improper storage, highlighting the absurdity of trying to fit something in an unsuitable space while the appropriate spot remains unused.\n\nThe \"Yes, But\" structure satirically emphasizes the disconnect between having the right solution and choosing a less practical option, creating the comedic effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since the show how even though refrigerator manufacturers design in-built egg trays, they are of no use to users who choose to put their entire box of eggs in the refrigerator"
