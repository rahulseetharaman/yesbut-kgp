  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of expectations and absurdity. The setup appears to depict a typical medical scene where a healthcare worker is administering a routine injection. However, the syringe is labeled \"lethal injection,\" which is unexpected and exaggerated. \n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" further adds to the humor by acknowledging that while it might look like a normal medical procedure at first, there is a comically absurd twist. The viewer anticipates a standard medical context, only to encounter an exaggerated and ridiculous scenario, creating a satirical effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as rubbing alcohol is used to clean a place on the arm for giving an injection, while the injection itself is 'lethal'."
