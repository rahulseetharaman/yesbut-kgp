  "final_answer": "The humor in the image arises from the juxtaposition of the expectation set by the text \"YES, BUT\" and the visual situation depicted. The license plate \"Y S B T\" humorously mirrors the phrase \"YES, BUT,\" suggesting that while something might seem straightforward, there's a complicating factor.\n\nIn this case, the person is trying to exit the car, which seems simple at first (\"YES\"), but the open door is blocked by the close proximity of the second car, complicating the task (\"BUT\"). This plays on the common real-life frustration of dealing with tight parking spaces, using wordplay and visual irony to create a humorous effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left door of the car is easily opened with still space left so the car could have been parked more on the left whereas the right door of the car is getting stuck due to the less space between the two cars and the person in facing difficulty in getting himself out but person on the left easily gets out"
