  "final_answer": "The humor in the image arises from the juxtaposition and irony highlighted by the text \"YES, BUT.\" On the left, there's a camouflaged SUV that looks rugged and ready for stealth in a natural setting, suggesting it could blend into its environment. However, the right side reveals an obvious crash with a bright red car in a setting with lush green trees.\n\nThe humor is in the contrast: despite its camouflage, intended for hiding, the SUV is involved in a conspicuous accident. The text emphasizes the irony, mocking the idea that camouflage would make the SUV less noticeable.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the left image a car is painted in camouflage color but in the right image the same car is getting involved in accident to due to its color as other drivers face difficulty in recognizing the colors"
