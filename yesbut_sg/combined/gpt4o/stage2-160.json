  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from illustrating a relatable frustration with tissue boxes. \n\nIn the left panel (\"YES,\"), a single tissue is being pulled out smoothly, which is the ideal scenario when using a tissue box. However, the right panel (\"BUT\") humorously contrasts this by showing multiple tissues being unintentionally pulled out at once. This is a common and frustrating experience, and the exaggeration highlights the everyday annoyance, making it funny and satirical. The simple setup effectively captures a shared inconvenience in a lighthearted way.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because even when there is a need of only one napkin but the napkins are so tightly packed that more than one napkin gets out sticked together"
