  "final_answer": "The image uses juxtaposition to create humor by contrasting two different dining scenarios. On the left, a silhouette depicts a clearly distinct cultural setting where a man and woman, in silhouette form, are using forks to eat salad and a burger, respectively. On the right, a colorful, more realistic drawing presents the same dining setup, but the woman uses chopsticks instead of a fork to eat a burger and fries.\n\nThe humor arises from the unexpected and impractical use of chopsticks for a food typically eaten with hands or forks, poking fun at how cultural practices don't always align with the context, leading to amusing or absurd outcomes. The \"YES, BUT\" text reinforces the contrast between cultural norms and real-life practicality, adding to the satire.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic because in the first image it is shown that the woman has got salad for her but she is having french fries from the man's plate which displays that the girl is trying to show herself as health conscious by having a plate of salad for her but she wants to have to have fast food but rather than having them for herself she is taking some from other's plate"
