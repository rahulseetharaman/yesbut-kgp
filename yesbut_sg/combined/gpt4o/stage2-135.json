  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the unexpected twist on expectations. The left panel shows a plain brown wooden chair, suggesting it should be used for sitting. The right panel humorously contradicts this by showing a woman sitting on a bathroom counter while taking a selfie, implying that although there is a \"proper\" place to sit, she chooses an unconventional one instead.\n\nThe caption \"YES, BUT\" highlights this contrast, poking fun at how people sometimes ignore traditional uses of everyday items in favor of more creative or humorous alternatives, often driven by the trend of capturing selfies in unique settings.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as a woman is sitting by the sink taking a selfie using a mirror, while not using a chair that is actually meant for sitting."
