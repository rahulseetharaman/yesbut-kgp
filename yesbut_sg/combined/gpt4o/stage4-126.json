  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the contrast between the two panels. The left panel features an exaggeratedly muscular torso wearing a tank top with a dark, aggressive design: a skull and the word \"KILL.\" This imagery conveys a serious and intense vibe, typically associated with toughness.\n\nIn the right panel, however, the scene shifts to a bearded person smiling and surrounded by colorful protein shakes with playful flavors like \"yummy yummy choco,\" \"teddy vanilla,\" and \"strawberry unicorn.\" This juxtaposition is funny because the person is wearing a tank top with a cute design, contradicting the aggressive tone of the first image. The unexpected combination of tough appearance with light-hearted and whimsical elements creates a satirical take on stereotypes about muscular people.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny because a well-built person wearing an aggressive tank-top with the word \"KILL\" on an image of a skull is having very childish flavours of whey protein such as teddy vanilla, yummy yummy choco, and strawberry vanilla, contrary to the person's external persona. This depicts the metaphor 'Do not judge a book by its cover'."
