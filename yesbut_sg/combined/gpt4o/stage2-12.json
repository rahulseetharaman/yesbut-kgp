  "final_answer": "The image is humorous and satirical because it highlights a contrast between real experience and social media portrayal. \n\nIn the first panel, a person seems to be sincerely praying in front of a serene Buddha statue. This suggests a moment of genuine meditation or spirituality. However, the second panel reveals that the person is actually taking a photo with a smartphone, crossing the line between a private, sacred ritual and a performative act meant for social media.\n\nThe hashtag #praying emphasizes the superficiality often associated with certain social media posts\u2014where the appearance of an action is more important than the authenticity of the action itself. It's a critique of how technology and social media can sometimes trivialize profound experiences.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image it seems that the woman is praying whole heartedly by bowing down in front of the statue but in the second image the same image is seen posted on the internet, so the woman was just posing for a photo to be posted on internet to gain followers or likes"
