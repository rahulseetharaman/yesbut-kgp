  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts traditional and modern behaviors. On the left, it shows a classic depiction of a woman praying to a Buddha statue, a serene and respectful scene. On the right, it portrays a modern scenario where a woman is in the same praying position but actually taking a photo of the statue, implying a focus on social media presence over genuine spiritual practice. The hashtag \"#praying\" and the social media icons further emphasize this irony, highlighting how modern life often blends or even replaces traditional practices with the obsession of sharing moments online.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image it seems that the woman is praying whole heartedly by bowing down in front of the statue but in the second image the same image is seen posted on the internet, so the woman was just posing for a photo to be posted on internet to gain followers or likes"
