  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the irony and juxtaposition. On the left, a package of vegan mayo is prominently labeled \"YES,\" emphasizing its vegan credentials. However, on the right, the person is pouring this vegan mayo onto a steak, labeled with \"BUT\". \n\nThe satire lies in the contradiction: while the mayo is vegan (suitable for those avoiding animal products for ethical or dietary reasons), it\u2019s being used on a non-vegan food item, a steak. This scenario humorously highlights the paradox of using a vegan product in a way that undermines its intended purpose.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as vegan mayo sauce is being poured on rib steak, which is non-vegetarian. The person might as well just use normal mayo sauce instead."
