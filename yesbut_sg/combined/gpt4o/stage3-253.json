  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of two activities that involve rowing motions. The first part of the image shows a person exercising on a rowing machine, which is a stationary fitness activity. The second part contrasts this with a person driving a speedboat on water, which is more leisurely and adventurous.\n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" adds to the satire by suggesting an agreement with doing an activity, \"yes\" to rowing, but presenting an arguably more exciting alternative, \"but\" to spending time on a speedboat. This contrast humorously highlights the difference between a mundane gym exercise and a thrilling outdoor activity.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because people often use rowing machine at the gym don't prefer rowing when it comes to boats"
