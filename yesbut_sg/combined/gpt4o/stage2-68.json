  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in the image stem from the contrast between the romantic ideal and the uncomfortable reality. \n\nIn the left panel, the scene appears idyllic and cozy, with the couple happily cuddling. This represents the idealized notion of sleeping together as a couple.\n\nIn the right panel, however, the man is visibly sweaty and uncomfortable, with a thermometer indicating heat, suggesting that cuddling can often lead to discomfort because of overheating. \n\nThe \"YES, BUT\" caption highlights this disconnect between expectation and reality, making it funny because it\u2019s a relatable commentary on how seemingly perfect scenarios can have unexpected downsides.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because after some time cuddling within a blanket raises the temperature which leads to inconvenience"
