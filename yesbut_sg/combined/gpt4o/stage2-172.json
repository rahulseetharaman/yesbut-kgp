  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in the image come from the juxtaposition of two contrasting panels. On the left, a businessman stands confidently in front of an upward-trending graph line with the text \"YES,\" suggesting success or prosperity. This is immediately contradicted by the right panel, where the text \"BUT\" accompanies a sharply downward-trending graph line, implying a sudden turn of events or failure. The play on expectations between the optimistic \"YES,\" and the negative \"BUT\" creates a humorous commentary on how initial success can quickly give way to decline, a common experience in business or investments.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because a person is seen feeling proud over the profit earned over his investment but the right image shows the whole story how only a small part of his investment journey is shown and the other loss part is ignored"
