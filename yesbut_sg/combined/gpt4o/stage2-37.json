  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition between the appealing price and the availability of sizes. The left panel shows a shoe at a great discount, which is enticing. However, the right panel reveals that nearly all common shoe sizes are sold out, leaving only very small and very large sizes (35 and 47) available. This highlights a common online shopping experience where enticing deals are undercut by limited availability, making the discount less practical or useful. The contrast between \"YES,\" (great price) and \"BUT\" (limited sizes) creates a humorous and satirical commentary on shopping frustrations.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny because while there is a big discount on the shoes inticing customer to buy them, the only available sizes are 35 and 47 which are the smalles and the largest meaning that a majority of the people can not buy the shoe because they won't fit."
