  "final_answer": "The image is funny or satirical because it highlights a humorous contradiction: using vegan mayonnaise on a steak. The left panel shows a pack labeled \"VEGAN MAYO,\" suggesting a focus on plant-based or animal-free diet choices. The right panel then contrasts this by showing the vegan mayo being poured onto a steak, which is typically not vegan. This juxtaposition creates irony, as the use of vegan products suggests a plant-based lifestyle, which is humorously undermined by the presence of meat.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as vegan mayo sauce is being poured on rib steak, which is non-vegetarian. The person might as well just use normal mayo sauce instead."
