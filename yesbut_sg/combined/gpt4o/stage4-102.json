  "final_answer": "The image humorously highlights a common marketing tactic used by tech companies. On the left, a phone promises a large storage capacity of \"256 GB,\" using a cartoonish design to emphasize the promise and excitement. This is followed by \"YES,\" suggesting agreement or approval.\n\nOn the right, another phone has a realistic design, revealing that the actual \"available storage\" is only \"235.35 GB,\" less than what was advertised, followed by \"BUT.\" This illustrates how consumers might be initially drawn in by the advertised specs but later discover the reality, which is often disappointing due to pre-installed software or system files consuming space.\n\nThe humor comes from the contrast between expectation and reality, poking fun at how marketing often glosses over practical details, leaving consumers to find them out the hard way.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since they show how smartphone manufacturers advertise their smartphones to have a high internal storage space but in reality, the amount of space available to an user is considerably less due to pre-installed software"
