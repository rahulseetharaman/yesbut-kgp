  "final_answer": "The image is satirical because it plays on the concept of \"not tested on animals\" in an unexpected way. Typically, this statement is used to assure consumers that a product was not tested on animals for ethical reasons. \n\nOn the left, there's a group of human silhouettes tagged with \"NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS,\" humorously suggesting that humans, rather than animals, were used for testing. On the right, a dog shampoo bottle is labeled with the same phrase, which is ironic and funny because it implies that it's meant for animals but still reassures it's not tested on them. \n\nThe juxtaposition of these elements plays with the expectations around product testing and cruelty-free claims, creating a comedic effect.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic since a dog shampoo bottle has a sticker indicating that it has not been tested on animals and hence might not be safe for animal use. It is amusing that a product designed to be used by animals is not tested on animals for their safety"
