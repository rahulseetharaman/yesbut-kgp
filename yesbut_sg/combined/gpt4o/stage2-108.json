  "final_answer": "The image is funny due to the stark contrast between the two panels. On one side, there is a person looking frustrated while studying math in front of a chalkboard filled with equations. On the other side, a person appears happy and is enjoying skateboarding at a skatepark.\n\nThe humor lies in the juxtaposition of the two situations: the common perception is that studying math can be stressful and frustrating, while skateboarding is often seen as fun and liberating. This contrast highlights different attitudes toward activities perceived as obligations versus those seen as recreational. The text \"YES, BUT\" enhances the comedic effect by acknowledging the reality of both experiences\u2014one may be engaging in challenging activities, but there\u2019s also joy to be found elsewhere.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical beaucse while the boy does not enjoy studying mathematics and different geometric shapes like semi circle and trapezoid and graphs of trigonometric equations like that of a sine wave, he enjoys skateboarding on surfaces and bowls that are built based on the said geometric shapes and graphs of trigonometric equations."
