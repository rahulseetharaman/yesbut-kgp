  "final_answer": "This image is satirical because it humorously critiques societal beauty standards. On the left, the \"Shouting Person\" is angrily tearing apart a detailed \"Beauty Standards Paper,\" representing frustration with complex and arbitrary beauty metrics. This symbolizes the rejection of unrealistic expectations placed on people.\n\nOn the right, the \"Calm Person\" is contentedly holding a simplified \"Beauty Standards Poster\" with \">180,\" likely referring to height in centimeters. It pokes fun at how quickly such standards can be reduced to a simplistic, yet still unreasonable, measure. The contrast between the two sides, along with the straightforward format of \"YES, BUT,\" highlights the absurdity of setting rigid beauty criteria, making it both funny and thought-provoking.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic because the woman that is angry about having constraints set on the body parts of a woman to be considered beautiful is the same person who is happily presenting contraints on the height of a man to be considered beautiful."
