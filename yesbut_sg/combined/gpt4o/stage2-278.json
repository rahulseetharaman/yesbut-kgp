  "final_answer": "The humor in this image lies in the juxtaposition and subversion of expectations. In the first panel, the scene appears typical: a ring girl stands between two male boxers, holding up a card indicating the round number. This setup is common and expected in boxing matches.\n\nHowever, the second panel introduces a twist: the male boxers have been replaced by female boxers. The caption \"YES, BUT\" suggests a contrast or an unexpected change to the viewer\u2019s expectations. The humor comes from highlighting assumptions about gender roles in sports, particularly in traditional settings like boxing. The image playfully challenges the stereotypical roles often seen in these scenarios, making a satirical commentary on gender dynamics in sports.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic since it shows how women are represented in our society. When it comes to a men's boxing match, a woman in revealing clothes is expected to hold out boards depicting round numbers but in a women's boxing match, they do not expect men to do so. It is poking fun at the gender roles that exist in our society"
