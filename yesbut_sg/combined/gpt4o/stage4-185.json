  "final_answer": "The image uses satire to highlight a contradiction in how people view animal captivity and exploitation. On the left, there\u2019s an elephant in chains and a person who is visibly upset about its captivity, indicating concern for animal welfare. On the right, it juxtaposes this concern with an image of people happily riding a free elephant, oblivious to the exploitation involved. The humor and satire come from pointing out this hypocrisy\u2014expressing empathy for animals in cages while participating in activities that also exploit them.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the people who get sentimental over imprisoned animal while watching TV shows often feel okay when using animals for labor"
