  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition in the panels and the use of irony. \n\nIn the first panel, there's a focus on a person with a striking, rainbow-colored hairstyle, setting them apart and creating an expectation of an expressive or festive context. The serious expression adds to the contrast, as it hints at an unexpected twist.\n\nThe second panel reveals a funeral scene. The same person with the colorful hair is attending the funeral, dressed appropriately except for the vibrant hair. This unexpected combination of a somber event with a flamboyant hairstyle creates a humorous and satirical effect, playing on how individual expression can sometimes clash with traditional norms and expectations. The \"YES, BUT\" title highlights this contrast by acknowledging the adherence to one norm while humorously breaking another.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the second image it is shown that a group of people is attending someone's death ceremony but one of them is shown as wrongly dressed for that place in first image, his visual appearances doesn't shows his feeling of mourning"
