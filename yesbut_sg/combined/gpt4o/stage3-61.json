  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts two aspects of self-care. On the left, people are excessively focused on skincare and grooming products, implying they're taking great care of their appearance. On the right, the reality is shown: unhealthy habits like poor sleep, excessive energy drink consumption, and smoking. It's funny because it highlights the irony of trying to maintain an external image of health and wellness while neglecting actual healthy living practices. The \"Yes, But\" format captures this satirical contrast effectively.",
  "ground_truth": "This image is ironic as on the one hand, the presumed person is into skincare and wants to do the best for their skin, which is good, but on the other hand, they are involved in unhealthy habits that will damage their skin like smoking, caffeine and inadequate sleep."
