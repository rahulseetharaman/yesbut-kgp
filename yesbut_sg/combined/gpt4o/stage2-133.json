  "final_answer": "The humor in the image arises from the redundant design of the carton. In the split view, the carton is depicted with both an unscrewed cap and an opened flap. Typically, only one opening method is needed for a carton, either a cap or a flap. The simultaneous use of both creates a humorous and absurd situation, as it highlights the unnecessary complexity or oversight in design. The caption \"YES, BUT\" adds to the comedic effect by emphasizing the contradiction between what is expected (opening via one method) and what is depicted (using both methods redundantly).",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because on the one side tetra packs have cap or lid for opening but on the other side the folded end seems inconvenient to handle"
