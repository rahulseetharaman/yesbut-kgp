  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts two different scenarios involving bicycles. On the left, a person is riding a bicycle over a short distance (6.23 km) with a short duration (17 minutes). On the right, a bicycle is shown on the back of a car, covering a much longer distance (97.45 km) and taking over two hours.\n\nThe humor lies in the satirical contrast between actually riding a bike for exercise or commuting vs. just transporting it on a car over a long distance. It pokes fun at the idea of having a bike for fitness or convenience but not actually using it for its intended purpose.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the person has to travel 2 hours just to ride his bicycle for 17 minutes"
