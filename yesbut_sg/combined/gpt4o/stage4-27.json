  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition and contradiction of the two scenes.\n\nOn the left side, seeds are being carelessly discarded into a trash bin, even though pumpkin seeds are edible and often enjoyed as a snack. Meanwhile, on the right side, a person is eating pumpkin seeds from a commercially labeled packet. This suggests the irony of people often discarding perfectly good natural food, only to buy the same product in a packaged form. The text \"YES, BUT\" emphasizes this contradiction, making the viewer recognize the absurdity of the situation.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because on one side the same person throws pumpkin seeds out of pumpkin into dustbin when brought at home but he is eating the package pumpkin seeds"
