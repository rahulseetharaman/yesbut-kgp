  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts two common behaviors related to job searching. On the left, a crowd eagerly surrounds a phone sending out a resume, symbolizing the enthusiasm and eagerness to apply for jobs. On the right, a person is rejecting an incoming call from an \"Unknown\" number.\n\nThe satire lies in highlighting how people can be very proactive in sending resumes but hesitant to engage in potentially important phone calls that could be related to those applications. This reflects the irony of being keen to connect with job opportunities yet reluctant to interact with unknown contacts, which might be essential. The humor is amplified by the juxtaposition of eagerness and reluctance.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because on the left image the person is sending their resume to someone and on the right they are rejecting the unknown calls which might be some offer calls  or the person who sent the resume maybe tired of the spam calls after sending the resume which he sent seeking some new oppurtunities"
