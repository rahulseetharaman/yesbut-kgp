  "final_answer": "This image humorously contrasts the complexity of academic learning with the joy of leisure activities. \n\nOn the left, a frustrated person is in a classroom trying to solve complex math equations on a chalkboard. This represents the stress and difficulty often associated with academic work.\n\nOn the right, a happy person with a cap and skateboard is near a skatepark, surrounded by skaters enjoying their time. This implies a carefree and enjoyable experience outside of academic pressures.\n\nThe caption \"YES, BUT\" cleverly highlights the irony that, while education is important, sometimes the simpler joys of life, like skateboarding, can be more fulfilling or enjoyable, creating a satirical take on the balance between work and play.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical beaucse while the boy does not enjoy studying mathematics and different geometric shapes like semi circle and trapezoid and graphs of trigonometric equations like that of a sine wave, he enjoys skateboarding on surfaces and bowls that are built based on the said geometric shapes and graphs of trigonometric equations."
