  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the contrast between the idealized and the realistic outcomes of baking. On the left, the cookbook presents a beautifully illustrated cake with strawberries, promising a perfect result. On the right, the reality shows a less-than-perfect cake and a pile of dirty dishes in the sink.\n\nThe title \"YES, BUT\" further accentuates this contrast. \"YES,\" you can follow the recipe and make a cake, \"BUT\" it comes with the messy aftermath that recipes often don't highlight. This juxtaposition humorously captures the common discrepancy between expectations and reality when cooking.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny, as when making a strawberry cake using  a recipe book, the outcome is not quite what is expected, and one has to wash the used utensils afterwards as well."
