  "final_answer": "The image is funny and satirical because it juxtaposes two different meanings of \"cleaning\" a smartphone. \n\nOn one side, it shows two cleaners literally using a squeegee and a mop to \"clean\" the large smartphone, implying a physical cleaning rather than digital. This humorous interpretation of \"cleaning\" is contrasted with a typical smartphone error message on the right side, which states \"Unable To Install \u00abPhone Cleaner\u00bb\" due to insufficient memory.\n\nThe satire highlights the absurdity of needing an app to \"clean\" your phone while playing on the literal act of cleaning, poking fun at common digital frustrations and the irony of tech maintenance.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as to clear the phone's memory using phone cleaner app, one has to install it, but that is not possible in turn due to the phone memory being full."
