  "final_answer": "The image is funny or satirical because it contrasts two very different activities that both involve \"rowing.\" \n\nOn the left, there's a person seriously exercising on a stationary rowing machine, sweating and working hard. This is associated with fitness and effort. The text \"YES,\" implies affirmation or approval of this kind of activity.\n\nOn the right, there is an icon of a person effortlessly steering a motorboat, relaxing while moving across water with the help of an engine rather than physical effort. The text \"BUT\" humorously suggests that despite using a different approach, the person in the motorboat achieves the same effect (traveling on water) with much less effort, poking fun at the hard work on the rowing machine. \n\nThe humor comes from highlighting these contrasting modes of \"rowing\" to emphasize the irony in effort versus ease.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because people often use rowing machine at the gym don't prefer rowing when it comes to boats"
