  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the idealized and the realistic versions of a picnic. \n\nOn the left, the \"YES\" side depicts a perfect, idyllic picnic scene in simple black and white. It\u2019s neat, orderly, and serene, with no distractions or annoyances, conveying an idealized expectation of what a picnic should be like.\n\nOn the right, the \"BUT\" side shows a more realistic version, cluttered and in color. It illustrates the common nuisances of picnics, like ants and flies swarming the food. This stark contrast highlights the often overlooked realities people face when actually having a picnic, making it funny and relatable. It\u2019s a satirical take on the difference between expectations and reality.",
  "ground_truth": "The Picture shows that although we enjoy food in garden but there are some consequences of eating food in garden. Many bugs and bees are attracted towards our food and make our food sometimes non-eatable."
