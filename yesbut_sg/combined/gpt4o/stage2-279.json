  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of expectations and reality. On the left, the scene shows a person being massaged, evoking a sense of relaxation and calm, which is expected from a massage. This is contrasted sharply with the right panel, where a finger is humorously and unexpectedly shown poking a large nose, adding a layer of surprise and absurdity. The caption \"YES, BUT\" highlights the playful shift from a serene scenario to a silly and unanticipated twist, creating a satirical take on how situations can take an unexpected turn.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since even though a woman goes for a full body massage expecting it to soothe her whole body, the design of a massage table is such that no matter how badly her nose itches, she cannot scratch it to soothe herself"
