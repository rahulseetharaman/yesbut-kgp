  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the ironic juxtaposition. The left side shows a figure holding a \"FastPass Entrance\" sign, suggesting a quicker way to get through a line. However, the right side humorously contrasts this by showing a crowded, long line labeled \"FastPass Entrance.\" \n\nThe caption \u201cYES, BUT\u201d emphasizes the contradiction between the promise of speed and the stark reality, poking fun at how supposed conveniences sometimes end up being just as time-consuming as the regular alternative. This satire highlights the irony of systems meant to expedite processes but ending up as time-consuming due to their popularity.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because fast pass entrance was meant for people to pass the gate fast but as more no. of people bought the pass due to which the queue has become longer and it becomes slow and time consuming"
