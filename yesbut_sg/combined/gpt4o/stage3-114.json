  "final_answer": "The image is satirical because it highlights the hypocrisy in people's attitudes towards animal welfare. In the left panel, a man is crying while watching a TV show depicting an elephant in chains inside a cage, showing his emotional reaction to the suffering of animals. However, the right panel contrasts this by showing a person taking a selfie while riding an elephant. The juxtaposition reveals the inconsistency in expressing concern for animals while simultaneously engaging in activities that may exploit them, such as elephant rides. The humor arises from this contradiction and the message it conveys about selective empathy.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the people who get sentimental over imprisoned animal while watching TV shows often feel okay when using animals for labor"
