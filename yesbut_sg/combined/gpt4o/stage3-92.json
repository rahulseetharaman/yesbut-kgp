  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from its play on expectations and exaggeration. On the left, there's a silhouette of a woman applying lipstick while looking at a mirror, suggesting a graceful or glamorous action. However, the right side humorously reveals the unintended consequence: lipstick marks on various drinking vessels like wine glasses, a martini glass, and mugs.\n\nThe text \u201cYES, BUT\u201d adds to the satire by acknowledging the beauty of wearing lipstick but poking fun at its impractical side. It's a humorous take on how lipstick can leave marks everywhere, highlighting a common, everyday annoyance in an exaggerated and playful manner.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left image suggest that a person applies lipsticks on their lips to make their lips look attractive or to keep them hydrated but on the contrary it gets sticked to the glasses or mugs and gets wasted"
