  "final_answer": "The image humorously captures the excitement and disappointment often experienced in soccer. On the left, silhouetted players are shown jubilantly celebrating a presumed goal, indicated by the text \"YES,\" which suggests a successful moment in the game.\n\nHowever, the right side of the image presents a stark contrast; a simple drawing depicts a goal with a stick figure referee holding a sign that says \"No Goal Offside.\" This juxtaposition plays on the common occurrence in soccer where a goal is disallowed due to the offside rule, turning a moment of celebration into one of frustration.\n\nThe humor comes from the contrast between the dramatic celebration and the anticlimactic announcement, poking fun at the emotional rollercoaster that soccer fans and players often experience.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as the team is celebrating as they think that they have scored a goal, but the sign on the screen says that it is an offside, and not a goal. This is a very common scenario in football matches."
