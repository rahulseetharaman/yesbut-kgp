  "final_answer": "The image is humorous because it highlights a common marketing exaggeration. The physical store sign claims a \"550% off\" sale, which is absurd and impossible, while the online post accurately states \"50% off only today.\" \n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" suggests that while people are excited by seemingly amazing deals (indicated by the crowd with shopping bags), there's often an unrealistic or misleading aspect to such claims. This juxtaposition satirizes how companies sometimes inflate their offers to grab attention, contrasting with more realistic advertisements online.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the poster of sale at a store is posted 3 days ago on a social media account which means the sale which was for only one day has become over"
