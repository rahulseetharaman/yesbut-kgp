  "final_answer": "The image humorously contrasts modern technology with traditional habits. On the left, there's a reverse camera screen showing the rear view and parking lines\u2014modern conveniences designed to aid drivers in reversing. On the right, the person is still turning their head to look backwards while reversing instead of relying on the camera. This contradiction is funny because it highlights how people often rely on familiar habits despite having advanced technology available. The person smiling adds to the humor, suggesting they are either unaware or amused by their own reliance on old-school methods.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are funny since even it shows how even though modern cars are fitted with features like reverse camera, drivers still choose to not use it and reverse the old fashioned way by looking behind"
