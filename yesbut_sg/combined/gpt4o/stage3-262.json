  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the juxtaposition of two related but contrasting scenes. On the left, you see a hand with a snake tattoo, which suggests a bold or edgy attitude. The text \"YES,\" implies acceptance or agreement.\n\nOn the right, the scene shows a person standing on a chair, clearly scared of a realistic snake on the floor. The text \"BUT\" indicates a contradiction to the boldness the tattoo suggests. This contrast between the fearless image of the tattoo and the person's frightened reaction to a real snake creates a humorous and ironic situation.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because in the first image the tattoo of a snake on someone's hand may give us a hint about how powerful or brave the person can be who is having this tattoo but in the second image the person with same tattoo is seen frightened due to a snake in his house"
