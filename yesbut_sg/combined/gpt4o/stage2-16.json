  "final_answer": "This image humorously contrasts two typical experiences with clothing tags. In the left panel, the shirt has a size label, which is straightforward. In the right panel, there's a price tag with a sensor, often found in stores to prevent theft. The humor arises from the common frustration that such tags, intended for security, can be cumbersome and intrusive. The \"Yes, But\" format suggests that while having a size label is standard, the addition of a bulky security tag makes things inconvenient, poking fun at a typical shopping annoyance.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because it shows over modernization, earlier the size was printed on the label attached to the clothes but now for knowing even the basic details about the cloth like size there is some barcode or QR code attached which need to be scanned by some mobile phone or electronic device"
