  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in this image come from the contrast between the intended use of the trash can and the actions of the person with the gum. \n\nOn the left, the trash can with a clear symbol emphasizes the proper behavior of disposing of trash responsibly. On the right, instead of using the trash can, the person is placing their gum on the rail, a place where it doesn't belong. \n\nThe title \"YES, BUT\" highlights the contradiction between knowing the right action (YES, the trash can) and doing something inappropriate (BUT, putting gum on the rail). This exaggeration of ignoring simple social norms creates a humorous and satirical effect, poking fun at people's occasional disregard for common sense.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic because even though garbage bins are provided for humans to dispose waste, by habit humans still choose to make surroundings dirty by disposing garbage improperly"
