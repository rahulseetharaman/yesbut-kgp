  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in the image stem from its depiction of a classic, idealized picnic juxtaposed with a less pleasant reality. \n\nIn the left panel, the picnic scene is idyllic with green grass, flowers, and a clean setup, suggesting an inviting and perfect outdoor experience. It represents the ideal expectation of a picnic: serene and picturesque.\n\nIn contrast, the right panel humorously subverts this expectation by showing the same setup overshadowed by numerous flies, represented by a gray background. This highlights an all-too-common, frustrating aspect of real-life picnics. The use of \"Yes, BUT\" in the panels emphasizes the ironic twist: while the picnic looks great in theory (\"Yes\"), the reality (\"BUT\") includes pesky flies.\n\nThis contrast effectively uses visual satire to poke fun at our romanticized notions of outdoor activities versus the sometimes annoying realities.",
  "ground_truth": "The Picture shows that although we enjoy food in garden but there are some consequences of eating food in garden. Many bugs and bees are attracted towards our food and make our food sometimes non-eatable."
