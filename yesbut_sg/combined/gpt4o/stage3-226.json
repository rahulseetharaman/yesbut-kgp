  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from contrasting expectations. The left side shows a large, colorful, and healthy salad overflowing from a bowl, suggesting an abundance of healthiness. A small silhouetted person next to it emphasizes its size and appeal. \n\nOn the right side, labeled \"BUT,\" a person is seen pouring a large amount of dressing over a smaller, sparse salad. This undermines the healthy aspect of the salad by illustrating how excessive dressing can negate its benefits. \n\nThe satire lies in the common tendency to turn a healthy meal into something less healthy by adding too much dressing, humorously highlighting how people can sabotage their good intentions.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironical, as salad in a bowl by itself is very healthy. However, when people have it with Mayonnaise sauce to improve the taste, it is not healthy anymore, and defeats the point of having nutrient-rich salad altogether."
