  "final_answer": "The image is funny and satirical because it highlights a common contradiction in efforts to be environmentally conscious. On one side, there is an \"eco bag,\" symbolizing a positive step towards reducing environmental impact by using reusable bags. However, on the other side, a stick figure is carrying numerous shopping bags filled with items wrapped in plastic packaging.\n\nThis juxtaposition humorously points out the irony of using an environmentally friendly product while still engaging in habits that aren't eco-friendly, like buying products with excessive plastic packaging. The image satirizes the superficial efforts to be eco-conscious while maintaining underlying habits that negate those efforts, delivering a critique on incomplete environmental activism.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because people nowadays use eco-bag thinking them as safe for the environment but in turn use products which are harmful for the environment or are packaged in some non-biodegradable material"
