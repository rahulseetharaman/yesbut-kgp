  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the contrast between the \"Yes, but\" format and the visual representation. The left side of the image, labeled \"Yes,\" shows a simple, minimalistic face with blue hair\u2014implies uniqueness or simplicity. The \"But\" on the right side humorously reveals a crowded scene of diverse, detailed faces, many also having colorful hair, suggesting that what seemed unique is actually quite common.\n\nThis visual twist satirizes how something perceived as unique or individualistic, like a bold hairstyle, can actually be a part of a widespread trend, highlighting the contradiction between striving for individuality and ending up being part of a crowd with the same choices.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is funny, as one person with a hair dyed blue seems to symbolize that the person is going against the grain, however, when we zoom out, the group of people have hair dyed in several, different colors, showing that, dyeing hair is the new normal."
