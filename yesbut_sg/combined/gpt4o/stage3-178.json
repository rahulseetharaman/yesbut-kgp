  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two screens and the reaction of the person. The left screen shows a chart with an upward trend, which typically signifies success or positive outcomes. The person is smiling and raising their arms, embodying happiness and triumph.\n\nHowever, the right screen displays a downward-trending chart, suggesting failure or negative results. The caption \u201cYES, BUT\u201d adds to the satire by highlighting how initial appearances or successes might be overshadowed by underlying issues. This contrast creates a comedic effect, as it mocks the tendency to focus only on positive aspects while ignoring potential problems.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because a person is seen feeling proud over the profit earned over his investment but the right image shows the whole story how only a small part of his investment journey is shown and the other loss part is ignored"
