  "final_answer": "The image humorously highlights a contradiction in how people express concern for animal welfare. \n\nOn the left, a man is shown looking concerned while watching a TV screen displaying a sad elephant in a cage. This suggests he cares about the elephant's plight. However, on the right, another scene shows tourists happily taking selfies and riding a docile elephant, which may imply animal exploitation for entertainment.\n\nThe humor and satire arise from the juxtaposition of these two scenes. The concern shown for the caged elephant contrasts sharply with the tourists' apparent disregard for the well-being of the elephant they are riding. This reflects a broader commentary on selective empathy and the inconsistency in attitudes toward animal rights.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the people who get sentimental over imprisoned animal while watching TV shows often feel okay when using animals for labor"
