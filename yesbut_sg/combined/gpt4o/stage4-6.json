  "final_answer": "The image uses humor and satire by contrasting two perspectives of fireworks. On the left, silhouetted people are joyfully celebrating under exploding fireworks, capturing the excitement and wonder of such displays. The word \"YES,\" emphasizes their enthusiasm.\n\nOn the right, under the title \"BUT,\" a dog and a cat are shown hiding under a cabinet, scared and anxious because of the fireworks. This juxtaposition highlights the overlooked impact of fireworks on pets, offering a humorous yet insightful commentary on how the same event can be a source of joy for humans and distress for animals.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is satirical because while firecrackers in the sky look pretty, not everyone likes them. Animals are very scared of the firecrackers."
