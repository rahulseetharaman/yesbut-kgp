  "final_answer": "The image uses humor and satire to highlight the common occurrence of lipstick marks on drinkware. The left side shows a woman applying lipstick, setting up the expectation (\"YES,\"). The right side, labeled \"BUT,\" humorously subverts this by showing a variety of drink containers all marked with lipstick prints. This plays on the clich\u00e9 of how people unintentionally leave lipstick marks on glasses, mugs, and bottles, creating a visual joke about the persistence of lipstick and its inevitable transfer onto drinking vessels.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left image suggest that a person applies lipsticks on their lips to make their lips look attractive or to keep them hydrated but on the contrary it gets sticked to the glasses or mugs and gets wasted"
