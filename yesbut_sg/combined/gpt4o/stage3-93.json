  "final_answer": "The image is funny or satirical because it contrasts the idealized notion of applying lipstick with the everyday, less glamorous reality. On the left, there's a silhouette of a woman applying red lipstick, which is often seen as a sign of beauty and care. However, the right side humorously undermines this by showing various drink glasses adorned with red kiss marks, implying that despite the effort to look perfect, there are always lipstick smudges left on objects in daily life. The text \"YES, BUT\" adds to the humor, acknowledging the effort to look polished with the inevitable messiness of reality.",
  "ground_truth": "The image is ironic, because the left image suggest that a person applies lipsticks on their lips to make their lips look attractive or to keep them hydrated but on the contrary it gets sticked to the glasses or mugs and gets wasted"
