  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the juxtaposition of expectations versus reality. On the left, the phrase \"YES,\" is paired with a simple icon of a trash can, symbolizing tidiness and order. It suggests an ideal situation where a mess is easily handled by disposing it in the trash can.\n\nOn the right, the word \"BUT\" introduces a twist: a person icon is bending over, interacting directly with a pile, which resembles something unpleasant or messy. This unexpected contrast between the straightforward solution implied by the trash can and the more complicated reality of dealing with a messy situation creates a humorous or satirical effect. The image plays on the idea that things are seldom as simple as they seem.",
  "ground_truth": "The images are ironic because even though garbage bins are provided for humans to dispose waste, by habit humans still choose to make surroundings dirty by disposing garbage improperly"
