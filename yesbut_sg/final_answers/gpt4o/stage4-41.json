  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in the image stem from the juxtaposition of the two panels with the captions \"YES,\" and \"BUT.\"\n\n- **Left Panel (\"YES,\")**: Shows a hand holding a typical iced drink in a cup with a straw, which is a common and straightforward way to enjoy a cold beverage.\n\n- **Right Panel (\"BUT\")**: Features a person silhouetted with a glass containing only ice cubes and a straw, emphasizing the absence of the actual drink. It humorously points out how sometimes, iced drinks seem to contain more ice than the drink itself.\n\nThis contrast is funny because it exaggerates the experience of ordering an iced drink, where it feels like you're left with just ice. The satirical element critiques the tendency of drinks being overly filled with ice, leaving little room for the actual beverage."
