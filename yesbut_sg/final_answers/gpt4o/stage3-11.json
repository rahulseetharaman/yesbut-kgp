The first traffic light looks normal, containing a pedestrian and bicycle icon, which typically means to stop. The second traffic light humorously includes a middle finger icon instead, conveying frustration or disapproval in a sarcastic manner.\n\nThe text \"YES, BUT\" at the top emphasizes the contradiction between following traffic rules (\"YES\") and the unexpected, comical rebellion shown by the middle finger (\"BUT\"). This contrast highlights everyday frustrations with a playful twist, making the image satirical and funny."
