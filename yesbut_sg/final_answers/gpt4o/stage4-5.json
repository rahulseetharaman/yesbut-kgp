On the left side, labeled \"YES,\" people are shown celebrating under dazzling fireworks, highlighting excitement and joy. It's a depiction of a common human enjoyment of festive events.\n\nOn the right side, labeled \"BUT,\" a cat and a dog are shown under a table, displaying calm and watchful behaviors, respectively. This side humorously represents how pets often perceive fireworks\u2014seeking shelter due to the loud noise and commotion. \n\nThe juxtaposition satirizes how humans celebrate without considering that animals might be frightened during such events. The simplicity of the illustrations enhances the comedic effect by emphasizing the stark contrast in reactions."
