  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in the image stem from the bouncer's selective enforcement of the dress code sign. The scene graph describes a bouncer blocking a casually dressed man while ignoring women in party attire as they walk past. The sign explicitly prohibits casual clothing, which the man is wearing, and yet the women are not stopped, highlighting a double standard. This reflects a societal critique on how rules are often applied inconsistently based on appearance or gender, making it humorous and satirical."
