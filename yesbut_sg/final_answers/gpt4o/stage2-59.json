  "final_answer": "The image humorously illustrates a common traffic scenario. The speed limit sign shows 130 km/h, yet in both panels, the trucks are moving much slower, at 80 km/h in the first panel. \n\nIn the second panel, the situation slightly changes: one truck speeds up marginally to 81 km/h, attempting to overtake, possibly highlighting the futility and frustration of slow traffic overtaking maneuvers. The humor stems from the exaggerated disparity between the allowed speed and the trucks' actual speeds, poking fun at real-life driving frustrations where vehicles often move much slower than the speed limit."
