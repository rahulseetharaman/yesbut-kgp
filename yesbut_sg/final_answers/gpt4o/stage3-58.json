On the left, a woman is shown sitting comfortably and formally in a well-designed seat, implying an ideal and relaxed seating situation.\n\nOn the right, however, two stick figures are depicted in awkward and uncomfortable positions on seats that are reclined or too upright, highlighting the discomfort and impracticality.
