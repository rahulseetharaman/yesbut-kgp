  "final_answer": "The humor or satire in this image comes from the juxtaposition between the two panels. \n\nThe left panel shows a silhouette of a boxing award scene where the boxers are holding up trophies, representing victory and success. The text \"YES,\" above this scene suggests achievement and recognition.\n\nThe right panel, however, shows a bruised and battered yet smiling boxer standing in a boxing ring. This contrasts sharply with the silhouette in the first panel. The text \"BUT\" implies there's a downside to the success depicted on the left. \n\nThis satirical image highlights the often overlooked sacrifices, pain, or struggles behind the moments of triumph, questioning the cost of success."
