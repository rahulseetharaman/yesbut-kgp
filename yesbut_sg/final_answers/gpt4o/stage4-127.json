The left side shows an empty basket labeled \"YES,\" suggesting readiness or capability, while the right side displays a person struggling with an exaggeratedly large and comical load of items, labeled \"BUT.\" This juxtaposition humorously captures the difference between the intention to do something simple and the reality of being overwhelmed by the complexities or burdens that follow.
