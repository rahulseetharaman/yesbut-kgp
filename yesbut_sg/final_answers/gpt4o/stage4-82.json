  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in the image come from juxtaposing the expected behavior with a common bad habit. On the left, there's a trash can, suggesting proper disposal of waste. The word \"YES,\" implies agreement with this notion. However, on the right, a hand is pinching and placing chewing gum on a fence, a location where it shouldn\u2019t be. The word \"BUT\" highlights the contradiction between knowing what\u2019s right and choosing to ignore it. This plays on the idea that people often recognize the correct action (using the trash can) but still act inappropriately (littering gum), critiquing human nature and behavior."
