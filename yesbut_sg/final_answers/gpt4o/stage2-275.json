The left panel showcases a perfect 5.0 rating with a full set of stars, suggesting an outstanding product or service. This creates a positive impression at first glance. However, the right panel humorously undercuts this by revealing that the rating is based on just one review. \n\nThe title \"YES, BUT\" cleverly sets up the joke by hinting at a contradiction. It's funny because it plays with the idea of taking statistical data at face value without recognizing how a single data point can be misleading. This satirical take on ratings systems emphasizes how appearances can be deceiving if you don't consider the context."
