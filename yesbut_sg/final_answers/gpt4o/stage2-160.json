  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from illustrating a relatable frustration with tissue boxes. \n\nIn the left panel (\"YES,\"), a single tissue is being pulled out smoothly, which is the ideal scenario when using a tissue box.

The simple setup effectively captures a shared inconvenience in a lighthearted way."
