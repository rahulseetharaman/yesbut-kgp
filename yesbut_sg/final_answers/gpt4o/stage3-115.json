  "final_answer": "The image uses satire to highlight the irony in people's attitudes towards animal captivity and tourism. \n\nOn the left, a person is shown thoughtfully watching a television depicting a small elephant in a cage, suggesting empathy or concern for animals in captivity. This scene might reflect how people often feel disturbed by animals being caged and mistreated when they see it on media.\n\nOn the right, the situation is flipped. A large elephant is used for tourism, carrying a person taking a selfie. This highlights the double standard where people might criticize animal captivity but still engage in activities that exploit animals for entertainment or tourism.\n\nThe \"YES, BUT\" caption further emphasizes this contradiction, pointing out the inconsistency between people's expressed concerns and their actions."
