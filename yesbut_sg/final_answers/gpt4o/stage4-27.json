Meanwhile, on the right side, a person is eating pumpkin seeds from a commercially labeled packet. This suggests the irony of people often discarding perfectly good natural food, only to buy the same product in a packaged form. The text \"YES, BUT\" emphasizes this contradiction, making the viewer recognize the absurdity of the situation."
