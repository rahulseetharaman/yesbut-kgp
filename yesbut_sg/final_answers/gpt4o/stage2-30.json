  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contradiction between the urgency of the sale message and the reality of its timing. The sign and the social media post both advertise a \"SALE 50% OFF ONLY TODAY!\" However, the social media post was made \"3 days ago,\" which means the supposed urgency and timeline are misleading. \n\nThis exaggerates the common tactic used by marketers to create a sense of urgency, satirizing how businesses often use the phrase \"only today\" repeatedly, making it meaningless. The \"YES, BUT\" caption emphasizes the contradiction between the immediate message and the outdated nature of the offer."
