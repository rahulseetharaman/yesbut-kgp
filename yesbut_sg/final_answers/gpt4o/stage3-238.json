  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the juxtaposition of two contrasting scenarios involving ducks.\n\nOn the left side, there's an image of a car stopping to let a duck and its ducklings safely cross the road. This is a common depiction of kindness towards animals. \n\nOn the right side, there\u2019s an image of a person heading towards a restaurant with a sign showing a duck on a plate, implying that ducks are served as food there. \n\nThe satirical element comes from the contrast: despite the effort to protect ducks on the road, they paradoxically end up as a dish in the restaurant. This contrast highlights the conflicting attitudes toward animals as creatures to protect versus food to consume."
