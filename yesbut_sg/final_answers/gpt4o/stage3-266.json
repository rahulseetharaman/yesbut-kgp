  "final_answer": "The humor in this image lies in the exaggerated contrast between the perceived value of an expensive pen and its mundane use. \n\nOn the left, the pen is depicted as a luxurious, sparkling item with a high price tag of $2,06.50. The stick figures are admiring and kneeling before it, suggesting that the pen is something highly revered and possibly a status symbol.\n\nOn the right, however, the pen is simply used to sign a paper with the name \"Bobo,\" highlighting its actual function\u2014writing, which can be done equally well by any ordinary pen. \n\nThe use of \"YES, BUT\" suggests that while the pen is indeed valuable and admired, its practical purpose remains trivial, creating a satirical commentary on how we often place undue importance on luxury items."
