  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the unexpected role reversal and the play on traditional boxing match stereotypes. Typically, a \"ring girl\" holds a sign to indicate the next round while male boxers prepare to fight. \n\nIn the first panel, this is shown conventionally with a cartoonish style. However, the second panel flips the scenario by having a woman boxer in the ring and a male figure in a similar outfit to a ring girl holding the sign. This reversal is humorous as it challenges gender norms and expectations in a satirical way, highlighting the absurdity of traditional roles in sports events."
