  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the setup and punchline presented across the two panels. \n\nIn the first panel, we see a transparent, empty mug with a handle, which closely resembles a beer glass. This sets up an expectation that the mug is functional and perhaps meant for drinking. \n\nThe second panel subverts this expectation by revealing a person using a completely different object\u2014a rectangular cup, typically less associated with drinking beer\u2014filled with beer. The person is drinking from this unusual object instead of the typical beer glass. \n\nThe captions \"YES,\" and \"BUT\" further emphasize this contrast. The humor lies in the unexpected choice of the drinking vessel, playing with the viewer\u2019s initial assumption and using the element of surprise for comedic effect."
