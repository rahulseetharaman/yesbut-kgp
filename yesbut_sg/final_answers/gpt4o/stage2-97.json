  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the contrast and unexpected twist presented in the weather forecasts. The phrase \"Yes, but yes,\" suggests an acceptance or inevitability, and each part of the comic plays into this idea using different weather predictions.\n\n1. **Clear Weekdays vs. Rainy Weekend**: The first column shows a series of sunny days during the workweek, representing a \"good week.\" The punchline comes when the weekend is depicted in the second column as cloudy and rainy, which is often the time people look forward to for leisure and outdoor activities.\n\n2. **Cycle Reset**: The third column returns to sunny weather at the start of the next week, humorously suggesting that the only rainy days happen just over the weekend.\n\n3. **Contrast and Juxtaposition**: The text, \"Yes, but yes,\" as the header juxtaposes an acceptance of both scenarios, highlighting the pattern that sunny days are not on the much-anticipated weekend, thus comically addressing the common disappointment of bad weekend weather.\n\nOverall, the image satirizes the common experience of perfect workweek weather followed by a rainy weekend, which many find humorously frustrating."
