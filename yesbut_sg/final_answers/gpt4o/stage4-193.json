  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition and contrast between two scenes. \n\nOn the left, there is a grand and stately depiction of a medieval castle and a regal king statue, evoking power, authority, and dignity. This creates an expectation of grandeur and nobility.\n\nOn the right, however, there's a cartoon of a king in a less dignified position, sitting on a toilet labeled \"WC\" inside a castle tower. This is unexpected and comically undermines the initial portrayal of royal majesty. The caption \"YES, BUT\" emphasizes the contrast, highlighting how even those with high status have ordinary human needs, which adds to the humor and satirical nature of the image."
