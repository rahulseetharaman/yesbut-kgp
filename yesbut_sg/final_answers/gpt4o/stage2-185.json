  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the ironic juxtaposition between the two panels. \n\nIn the left panel, the person is holding an X-ray image of teeth, which humorously reveals \"unnecessary detail\" \u2014 X-rays are known for showing intricate details not visible to the naked eye. \n\nIn the right panel, the person is holding a picture of a car accompanied by a magnifying glass, humorously suggesting that seeing the car requires magnification, which is ironic because cars are large objects that typically don't need a tool for better visual inspection.\n\nThe unexpected switch between what naturally requires close scrutiny and what does not creates a satirical twist. The person's surprised reaction in the right panel adds to the comedic effect, emphasizing the absurdity of needing a magnifying glass to see something as obvious as a car."
