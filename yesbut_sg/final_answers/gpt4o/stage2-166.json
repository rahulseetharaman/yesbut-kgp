Their excitement is evident, capturing the joy of scoring in a sports match. However, the second panel depicts a sign that says \"NO GOAL,\" \"VAR,\" and \"OFFSIDE,\" indicating that the goal was disallowed due to a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) review for offside.\n\nThe satire arises from the common experience in modern football where players prematurely celebrate, only to have their celebration cut short by a VAR decision. This unexpected shift from celebration to disappointment is a humorous take on how technology, like VAR, impacts sports and player experiences."
