  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of a peeler and ginger across two panels. The first panel shows the peeler with the caption \"YES,\" suggesting it's a useful tool for peeling. The second panel shows ginger with the caption \"BUT,\" highlighting the impracticality of using a peeler on its uneven, knobby surface. The contrast between the expectation of the peeler's utility and the reality of ginger's challenging shape creates a humorous and relatable scenario, as many people have experienced the difficulty of peeling ginger with a standard peeler."
