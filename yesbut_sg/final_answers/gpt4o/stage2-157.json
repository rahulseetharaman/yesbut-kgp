The first panel presents a serene and picturesque view of the ocean through a window, suggesting a calm and peaceful scene. However, the second panel humorously subverts this expectation by depicting a massive wave shaped like a hand overshadowing beachfront buildings, creating an absurd and surreal twist.

The contrast between calm and threat is a common comedic technique used to create surprise and humor."
