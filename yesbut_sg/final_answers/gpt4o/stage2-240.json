  "final_answer": "The humor in this comic comes from the juxtaposition of two contrasting scenes labeled \"YES,\" and \"BUT\". \n\nOn the left panel, a person is exercising on a rowing machine and appears to be working hard, indicated by sweating and wearing a headband. The scene represents someone putting in effort to simulate rowing indoors.\n\nIn contrast, the right panel shows a person sitting relaxed in a motorboat on the ocean. This person is not exerting any physical effort, as the boat provides propulsion.\n\nThe satirical humor arises from the idea of exercising hard indoors on a machine that simulates rowing, versus casually operating a motorboat which moves with ease outdoors. It highlights the irony between exercising for fitness and experiencing actual movement in a more leisurely and effortless way."
