  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition and contrast between the idealized, simplistic icon of a woman sitting on a seat and the realistic depiction of how a real woman sits. \n\nOn the left, the \"symbol_woman\" is depicted as an icon, often seen in public signage, representing an unrealistically perfect, comfortable sitting posture on an \"icon_seat.\" \n\nOn the right, the \"real_woman\" is shown sitting in a more relatable, less perfect manner, with the \"real_seat\" showing a dimple from her weight. This realistic portrayal humorously contrasts with the flat, idealized version, highlighting the difference between how things are depicted symbolically and how they actually are in real life. \n\nThe caption \"YES, BUT\" reinforces this contrast by humorously acknowledging the idealized representation but quickly pointing to the more accurate, real-life situation."
