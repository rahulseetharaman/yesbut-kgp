  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the exaggeration and contrast between the two panels. The left panel shows a normal, healthy salad, suggesting an intent to eat something light and nutritious. However, the right panel humorously contradicts this by showing an excessive amount of mayonnaise being poured onto the salad. This exaggeration plays on the idea of trying to eat healthy but subverting that effort with unhealthy toppings. The \"Yes, But\" format emphasizes the internal conflict or contradiction in intentions."
