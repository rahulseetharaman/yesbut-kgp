  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of expectations versus reality. In the first panel, we see a person wearing a swim cap, suggesting that they intend to be streamlined and aerodynamic in the water. Swim caps are generally worn to reduce drag by keeping hair contained. \n\nHowever, the second panel reveals that the person has a very hairy chest, which contrasts with the smooth, streamlined expectation set by the swim cap. The comic plays on the idea that while the swim cap serves a specific purpose, it seems almost futile given the presence of so much hair, which could also create drag. This unexpected contrast creates a humorous effect."
