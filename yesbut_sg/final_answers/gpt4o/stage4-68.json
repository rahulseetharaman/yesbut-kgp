However, they are using items like a laptop and a professional camera, which are products of capitalism.\n\n2. **Consumer Goods**: The presence of a branded coffee cup and tech items indicate engagement with capitalist products, adding to the irony.\n\n3. **\"YES, BUT\" Text**: The text above highlights the contradiction, pointing out that one can claim to be against capitalism (\"YES\"), but still participate in it (\"BUT\") through everyday actions.\n\nThis contrast creates satire by illustrating the common struggle between ideological beliefs and practical daily life in a consumer-driven society."
