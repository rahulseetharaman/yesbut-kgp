  "final_answer": "The humor in this image arises from the contrast between the two panels. \n\nOn the left, a large group of ducks is seen crossing the road at a crosswalk, stopping traffic. This is a common scene where animals are given priority, and the text \"YES\" suggests agreement with this polite behavior.\n\nThe right panel, labeled \"BUT,\" depicts a restaurant named \"Peking Duck,\" which is known for serving duck dishes. This creates ironic humor, as the restaurant suggests a more ominous fate for the ducks, contrasting sharply with the earlier image of them safely crossing the road. The juxtaposition of the two scenarios creates a satirical twist on the situation."
