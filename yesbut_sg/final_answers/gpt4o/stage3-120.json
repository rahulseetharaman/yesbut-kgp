  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the celebratory scene on the left and the satirical depiction on the right. \n\nOn the left, there is a boxing ring with a referee raising the hand of a victorious boxer, surrounded by a cheering crowd. This setup is typical of a triumphant moment after a sports victory.\n\nOn the right, the image shows a boxer in a disheartened state, with visual elements like sweat or bruises on the figure, conveyed through a stylized dripping effect. \n\nThe juxtaposition with the words \"YES, BUT\" highlights the irony: while the boxer is triumphant in terms of winning, the image humorously acknowledges the physical toll and exhaustion that accompanies such a victory. It's a comedic way to emphasize that behind every victory, there's often a less glamorous reality."
