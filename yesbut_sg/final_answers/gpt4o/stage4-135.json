  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two panels. On the left, a handheld console is shown as a portable and self-contained entertainment device that can be used without needing an internet connection, which makes it ideal for environments like an airplane. The person is enjoying an uninterrupted gaming experience, indicated by the text \"YES.\"\n\nOn the right, a person is using a phone on an airplane and looking at the airplane window, which humorously states \"NO INTERNET\" and implies that the games and apps on the phone are unusable without an internet connection. The juxtaposition highlights the reliance on the internet for mobile phone activities and the inconvenience it causes during travel, especially on flights where internet access can be limited or unavailable. This contrast is captured in the text \"BUT,\" emphasizing the downside of phones compared to more versatile handheld gaming consoles in such situations."
