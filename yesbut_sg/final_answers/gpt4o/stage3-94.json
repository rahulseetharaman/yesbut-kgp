  "final_answer": "The humor in the image comes from the contrast between the two panels, highlighted by the text \"YES\" and \"BUT.\"\n\nOn the left, the silhouette scene depicts a mystical and magical setting, with a person successfully using a crystal ball labeled \"FORTUNE,\" suggesting they have the power to predict the future.\n\nOn the right, the humorous twist shows a modern scenario where the crystal ball displays a computer-like \"Unknown error\" message. This juxtaposition satirizes the idea of fortune-telling by showing how unreliable and error-prone it would be if it were like today's technology. People are shown with items like lottery tickets and investing apps, adding to the satire by highlighting how people look for certainty in the unpredictable world of finances and luck. The humor lies in the expectation of mystical powers being debunked by a mundane technical issue."
