  "final_answer": "The humor and satire in this image come from the juxtaposition of the sign's message and the depicted scene. On the left, the \"YES\" part, shows a green pedestrian light, signaling it's safe for pedestrians to cross. This typically implies that the path is clear and crossing is safe. \n\nHowever, on the right, the \"BUT\" part shows a car near the pedestrian crossing with no visible pedestrians crossing. This suggests a potential obstacle or contradiction in the implied safety of the green light. The phrase \"YES, BUT\" highlights this irony, pointing out that even with a green light, conditions may still be unsafe or uncertain, humorously criticizing the reliability of pedestrian signals."
