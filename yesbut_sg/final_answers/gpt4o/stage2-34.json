  "final_answer": "This image uses satire to highlight a humorous contradiction. In the first panel, the character is wearing gloves while handling food, which is a standard hygiene practice. However, the second panel shows the same character using the same gloves to handle money, which is unsanitary and defeats the purpose of wearing gloves. This inconsistency is amusing as it points out the irony of trying to maintain cleanliness in one scenario while neglecting it in another. The \"Yes, But\" text underscores the contradictory actions, enhancing the comic effect."
