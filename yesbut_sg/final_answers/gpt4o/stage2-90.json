  "final_answer": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two panels and the concept of double standards. In the first panel, a man is casually eating chips and ignoring a woman who is vacuuming and looks annoyed. This could suggest a typical domestic scene where one person is lounging while the other is working, highlighting a stereotype of unequal domestic responsibilities.\n\nIn the second panel, labeled \"BUT,\" the roles reverse. The woman is now eating messily in a car, creating a mess with crumbs on her shirt, while the man is driving. This flip illustrates that both genders can exhibit similar behaviors in different contexts, creating a satirical take on the typical expectations of domestic roles and behaviors. The humor lies in the exaggerated and unexpected role reversal."
