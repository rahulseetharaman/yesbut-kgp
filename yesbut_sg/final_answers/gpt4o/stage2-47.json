On the left, labeled \"YES,\" there's an idyllic scene with a hiker walking toward a bright sun, colorful rainbow, and scenic mountains, suggesting a perfect, inspirational journey with nature\u2019s beauty.\n\nOn the right, labeled \"BUT,\" the hiker stands at the peak, and instead of the vibrant view, there's only a dull, gray, cloudy atmosphere.

The satire lies in the mismatch between the hopeful anticipation of adventure and the sometimes underwhelming reality."
