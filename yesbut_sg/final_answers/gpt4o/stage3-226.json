The left side shows a large, colorful, and healthy salad overflowing from a bowl, suggesting an abundance of healthiness. A small silhouetted person next to it emphasizes its size and appeal. \n\nOn the right side, labeled \"BUT,\" a person is seen pouring a large amount of dressing over a smaller, sparse salad.
